To the editor: There are other issues involved in philanthropic giving than those addressed by Zev Yaroslavsky and Bill Parent. ("Rich Angelenos are giving less to charity — and the consequences are dire," Opinion, May 6)

Our society's entire approach to charity has changed. Getting big amounts of money for innumerable causes has become a big movement. Often the initial objective — the charitable need — is obscured by other priorities.

Sadly, there are abuses. Some charities are scams altogether. Some monies spent are misdirected away from the basic intent. Too much money is expended for the business of solicitation.

Those of us who may have been raised with the ancient principle of social responsibility have had to become wary of the slick and sometimes sick approaches to charity. When we give, we really want the contribution to go to the prime cause. We have learned to become more selective.

We don't want the “free gift” that really just tells us that getting our cash is the most important consideration. We also resent the repetitive bombardment with monthly solicitations. When we donate, we don't want that hidden message that our contribution is not enough.

The apparent reduction in philanthropy has been caused in part by the abuse of our generous instincts.

To the editor: Yaroslavsky and Parent make a very good case for the support needed by charities in Southern California.

I consult Charity Navigator when checking to see the effectiveness of a given organization, but many local groups are not found in this national database. It would be very helpful if it or The Times could refer readers to a similar local resource.
