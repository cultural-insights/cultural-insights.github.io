To the editor: Reading the story about our lack of infrastructure spending really made me mad. The most glaring, obvious reason is that more than half of the federal government’s discretionary spending goes toward the military, which was not mentioned in the article. (“Why this is the perfect time to invest in infrastructure, and why it probably won’t happen,” July 19)

Our thirst for war (keeping us safe, right?) costs us hundreds of billions of dollars every year, so there is very little left over at the end of the day for infrastructure, including highways, schools and more.

You may call me a dreamer, but what would our world look like if we spent our wealth on infrastructure both here and abroad? Now, that would really be winning hearts and minds, not to mention keeping everybody safer.

To the editor: Infrastructure investment when interest rates are low and when the country would benefit from the employment? What a good idea!

Thanks to Rep. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) for advocating it by supporting a national infrastructure bank, and thanks to The Times for highlighting why it is not happening.

We seem collectively to have forgotten all the benefits that spring from government and from cooperation between levels of government and between government and industry. There’s even a book written by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson entitled “American Amnesia,” an eloquent and articulate exploration of this phenomenon.

When will we quit voting against our own interests and begin, once again, to invest in our future?
