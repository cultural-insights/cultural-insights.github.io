To the editor: That suspension rates of minority students are higher than whites is gravely concerning. Trying to understand this discrepancy requires understanding how children are prepared for school. (“Black preschool kids get suspended much more frequently than white preschool kids, U.S. survey says,” June 6)

Years before kids may be exposed to the effects of teacher racial bias, as studied by Stanford psychologist Jason Okonofua, they have myriad opportunities in families and communities to experience adult-child relationships. Even preschoolers arrive with preconceived notions about the adult in charge.

Children in families where physical punishment is used routinely or authoritarian methods of child-rearing predominate clearly do not learn to internalize adult expectations. The prevalence of spanking in the United States is as high as 65% for children 19-35 months of age and is associated with less long-term behavioral compliance.

Parents of all racial and ethnic backgrounds would benefit from programs that educate them about best parenting practices to prepare children for group educational settings.
