To the editor: In the 1980s, I was a new teacher of blind students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Previous to my teaching career I had been in the music business; as a result I had the opportunity to ask Prince to do a show for special needs children in L.A. I was surprised and pleased that he said yes and had his people put together a date at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

The students were bused to the show not knowing whom they were going to see. Prince did not want publicity for this, so only a few people knew about it.

It was so thrilling to see the kids' reaction when they learned whom they were going to see in this surprise show. It was financed entirely by Prince, who had just finished a stint of sold-out shows at the Forum in Inglewood as part of his world tour in 1984-85.

Hundreds of children watched the concert from their wheelchairs, and Prince provided signers for the deaf students. For many of the children, it would be the only live show they would ever see.

Prince was a loving, generous and gentle man. He will be missed here on Earth but will be a great addition to the angels in heaven.
