To the editor: The Times seems to have accepted Santa Monica's official pronouncements about the Expo Line as facts. ("Will Santa Monica's Expo Line get you out of your car?" April 20)

The Expo Line will not serve the majority of commuters traveling into or out of the city — the people who live or work in Malibu, Pacific Palisades, the San Fernando Valley, the South Bay and most of the Westside. It will not reduce the number of city employees who drive (according to a 2015 public records request, every employee is given free parking and, since 2008, 22% fewer use public transit).

It will not ease congestion in downtown Santa Monica, where new development is approved with nearly complete disregard for city plans. The Expo Line will, however, bring people to the city's stores and restaurants, and that's the most likely reason for officialdom's zealous support.

Santa Monica residents are realizing more and more that it's easier to patronize Westside Pavilion or Century City. It takes less time to get there and, unlike Santa Monica, parking is validated.

To the editor: I have to disagree with the statement that expanding rail service “isn't going to change habits overnight.”

If the Metro Purple Line, currently making its slow extension westward, had a stop at the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax — five blocks from my office — I'd gladly give up the exorbitant monthly parking rate I pay and be on the train tomorrow.
