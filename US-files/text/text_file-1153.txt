To the editor: I disagree with Dan Johnson's premise that the “new” downtown Los Angeles being built is a “disingenuous stale version.” ("Downtown L.A. isn't 'vibrant,' it's a gritty melting pot. And that makes it even more compelling," Opinion, April 19)

He uses hyperbole without an intellectually supportable premise. The concepts of “vibrancy” and “visceral” are vague and meaningless.

What is real are the attractions motivating a threefold population growth and substantial business investment here. The Broad Museum and MOCA are real, as are Disney Hall, Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson Theatre and the Taper Forum. Broadway has unique, opulent movie theaters. Enjoy a walk to Grand Central Market, California Plaza or Olvera Street. And how about Little Tokyo, St. Vibiana, Chinatown, the Bradbury, Union Station and a transit system that will soon connect to the ocean?

I haven't forgotten Johnson's concerns that this is all colored by our most serious homeless problem. The governmental push to solve the problem is underway and will be successful. My reality therefore is the ability to walk to and enjoy the best of art, theater, dining, great weather, congenial people and Latino notes of this great downtown metropolis.
