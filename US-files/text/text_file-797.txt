Sunday, in the wake of the Orlando massacre, The Times’ editorial board wrote about “our national failure to address gun violence,” calling it “one of the embarrassments of our age.” That same day, here in Los Angeles, a man was arrested with assault rifles and explosives-making materials in his car before the L.A. pride parade. The parade went on, albeit with a more somber tone than in years past.

Many outlets, The Times included, are covering Orlando as a terrorist attack and are focusing primarily on the attacker and the geopolitical implications of his assault. But to the LGBT community, this attack merits far more than a clinical policy discussion. It hit viscerally — and many believe that the ongoing danger their community faces has been erased in these conversations.

Here is what prominent queer writers are saying about the attack and the media aftermath:

Republicans Are Erasing LGBTQ People From Their Own Tragedy, Mark Joseph Stern, Slate

“Let’s be clear about this: The 50 victims of Orlando’s LGBTQ nightclub massacre died as full and equal citizens under the law in spite of the Republican party’s best efforts to relegate them to second-class citizenship.”

What It Costs to be Gay in Public, Dave Holmes, Esquire

“The FBI defines terrorism as ‘violent acts or acts dangerous to human life…that appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.’ LGBT people around the world have been intimidated and coerced all our lives.”

Queer People’s Battle to Not Be Murdered Will Not Be Won with Platitudes, Laurence Barber, MEDIUM

“Realistically, the shift that needs to happen to reduce and prevent murders of LGBTQI+ people won’t come through promoting #EqualLove. It will come through normalising non-traditional sex.”

Love in the Time of Orlando, Les Fabian Brathwaite, OUT

“There is an infinite amount of love available to you, and only a finite amount of hate. Because to hate requires effort, but to live is the purest expression of love. And to love is to live fully and freely.”

Stop Exploiting LGBT Issues to Demonize Islam and Justify Anti-Muslim Policies, Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept

“The struggle of LGBTs around the world is difficult enough without having them cynically used as some sort of prop to bash a group that itself is already being bashed from multiple directions.”

People Are Coming Out As LGBT In Response To The Orlando Attack, Alan White & Patrick Strudwick, BuzzFeed

“‘I’ve never been ‘out’. But today I stand proudly and publicly with my siblings of all genders around the world.’ LGBT people tell BuzzFeed News why the massacre prompted them to speak out.”

Please Don’t Stop the Music, Richard Kim, The Nation

“To all the bartenders and bar-backs and bouncers and gogo boys and drag queens and club kids and freaks who make the nightlife—I love you. Stay strong.”

Queer Is Invincible, Alex Frank, The Fader

“Pride is an imperfect weapon, but it can’t be taken away.”
