To the editor: Democrats have always been patriotic; we have always loved this country. ( “Patriotism swaps parties,” July 31 )

But our country is like our children. As good parents, we don’t love our children uncritically. We want our children to try their hardest to reach the goals that make them better people.

And when they fail — because the goals they set were unkind, selfish or just wrongheaded or because they didn’t try hard enough — we are disappointed. But that doesn’t mean we don’t love them; it just means that we need to urge them to work harder and to see more clearly what is right.

And, like parents, we support our troops, but we don’t want them sent out to risk their lives for something that doesn’t merit it. When we argue against war, we are not criticizing those who serve, we are supporting and protecting them.

Democrats haven’t taken patriotism from Republicans. The Republicans have just successfully confused the message. No more.

To the editor: Really? I’m not sure which DNC you were watching.

There was not a flag to be seen on Day 1. On Day 2, if you knew where to look, you could see four flags on each side of the stage, which angled back away from the podium.

Is that a show of patriotism? I don’t think so.

To the editor: Your headline writers need to get a grip on reality. Democrats have always been patriotic, so what’s with this “swap” thing?

Additionally, Democrats aren’t concerned with displaying false pride. They’re concerned with world and domestic matters, climate change, issues that really matter.

They’re concerned with America’s pledge that “liberty and justice” is what all people deserve because all people are human beings.

Democrats don’t have to screech what patriots they are.
