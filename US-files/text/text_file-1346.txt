To the editor: Buried within Jonah Goldberg's piece was a workable idea for defeating Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that I'm going to follow: for Californians to register Republican even if the party doesn't represent their views and vote for another candidate in the June primary. This could deny Trump enough delegates to lock up the GOP nomination. ("How to stop Donald Trump," Opinion, April 5)

Do I feel odd or disingenuous? No. I've felt very odd for a long time now as a major political party has allowed a vacuous TV personality to foment hate. It's the Republican Party that is disingenuous, feigning shock that voters have responded favorably to Trump.

That leaves thinking voters to devise a plan themselves to keep our country out of the hands of maniacs. I've heard people say Democrats ought to help Trump because he would be the weakest nominee. But that seems too risky.

I'm imagining my welcome letter from the California Republican Party after I mail in my form. It can save a stamp. I'll be changing back to “decline to state” exactly one minute after I vote on June 7.

To the editor: When Goldberg asked readers to help him and the GOP figure out how to stop Trump, I thought briefly about offering a suggestion.

Then I decided not to. He and the GOP need to suffer the political consequences they have earned. Maybe then they'll begin a return to rationality.

To the editor: Goldberg deserves kudos for jump-starting bottom-up democracy by inviting readers to submit ideas for dumping Trump.

However, their ideas sacrifice simplicity for cleverness. Simply let Trump hoist himself by his own petard. Give him more air time, not less. The more he says, the more likely he is to make tone-deaf statements like advocating punishment for women who have abortions.
