To the editor: With the Tennessee governor's veto of his legislature's bill to make the Bible the official state book, they should consider so honoring some constitutionally compliant tome. ("Tennessee's governor vetoes Bible as state book," April 17

How about a book from the non-fiction realm, something that conveys enlightening, incontrovertible truths rather than preachy, faith-based fables? Something that might help Tennesseans focus on reality and better see their way in life?

My humble suggestion is an empirical classic: “On the Origin of Species,” by Charles Darwin.

As the official state book, Darwin's work might well inspire Tennessee's public schools to spurn the teaching of creationism — currently authorized under state law — and instead imbue their students with evolutionary truths to better understand and appreciate humans' existence.

To the editor: Verily, it's a miracle of biblical proportions! Legislation to adopt the Bible as the state book of Tennessee cited a report that had run in The Times: “Even the Los Angeles Times has acknowledged the economic impact of the Bible in Tennessee.”

Alas, that stunning concession from an infamously secular daily didn't dissuade the governor from vetoing the “Bible bill” as blatantly unconstitutional. So now pious Tennessee legislators appear hell-bent on overriding it.

The governor should move to clarify the record with a parenthetical addendum to The Times' acknowledgment — say “although this newspaper approvingly prints letters from its readers expressing their profound dismay at insidious efforts to install a Christian theocracy.”

Perhaps this clarification will provoke a revelation that helps Tennessee legislators see the proverbial light.
