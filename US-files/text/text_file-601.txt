To the editor: This is to congratulate and thank The Times for exposing Donald Trump’s vicious and underhanded business practice of trying to discredit a potential competitor by falsely and maliciously accusing the St. Regis Mohawks tribe — which was trying to open a competing casino in New York state, not far from Trump’s operations in Atlantic City, N.J. — of drug trafficking. (“Trump was once so involved in trying to block an Indian casino that he secretly approved attack ads,” June 30)

This kind of investigative reporting is sorely needed to accurately portray the lack of character and honesty of the Republican Party’s choice to become president of the United States. It is inconceivable that patriotic and ethical citizens of any political party could, in good conscience, support a man of such base moral turpitude.

Please keep up the good work of reporting the truth.

To the editor: Really? Again? The Times’ bias in its coverage of the presidential campaign is so stark and, quite frankly, shameless that I think you really owe your readers an explanation.

Both Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton present fertile subjects for investigation, but only Trump gets the ongoing in-depth assault. I would really like to see an editorial explaining how and why this approach is taken, and how it squares with basic journalistic ethics.
