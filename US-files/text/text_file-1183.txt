To the editor: Jonah Goldberg is still whaling away at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. Now he is trying to pressure Indiana Gov. Mike Pence into endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz. ("It's time for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to make up his mind if he's for or against Donald Trump," Opinion, June 26)

Poor Pence is apparently suffering from the same problem afflicting most mainstream Republicans these days — whether to wreck the GOP ship on Scylla or Charybdis.

I don't blame the governor for staying in his bunker and refusing to choose. Sometimes the lesser of two evils is still too evil.

To the editor: And now Cruz — the best bad option, according to many Republicans — is announcing Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential pick. Perhaps the senator doesn't realize that Fiorina makes many of us ashamed to be Californians.

This is like taking the poison with a shot of kerosene.
