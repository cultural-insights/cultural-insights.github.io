To the editor: The recent release of the body-camera video of the shooting of Dylan Noble in Fresno provided some additional facts that ring of a familiar tone. In this instance, as in many other police shootings I have read about in The Times, the encounter became volatile when the suspect refused to follow the commands of the police officers. (“Fresno police release dramatic body-camera footage of fatal shooting of unarmed 19-year-old,” July 14)

Here, the Fresno police officers asked Noble repeatedly to show his hands or to lie on the ground. He refused to obey them and instead reached for an object in his waistband and was thereafter shot.

If we are to teach our children anything about encounters with the police, it is to comply with the commands of officers even if we do not feel they are warranted. If we later feel that our rights have been violated, there are plenty of lawyers around who will handle our case.

Had Noble simply followed the initial instructions of the officers, he might be alive today.

To the editor: Police kill an unarmed white teen in Fresno, and there isn’t widespread outrage. We need standard nationwide police tactics to avoid the unnecessary use of deadly force.

Here’s what I propose: Have one cop approach a subject with his or her gun drawn, while all other officers have their guns holstered; disable people wielding knives, hammers or rocks using clubs, mace, dogs, rubber bullets or other non-lethal force; and voice commands more calmly instead of shouting at them.

We all are in danger if one minor movement can result in a hail of bullets. It’s time for cooler heads to prevail.
