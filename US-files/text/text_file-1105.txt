To the editor: Having grown up in now economically distressed southern Oregon, I was interested in this article, which ran under a banner that read “Trump nation” in the print edition. It was a story from Cave Junction, Ore. ("In a down-on-its-luck Oregon mill town, the savior they're waiting for is Donald Trump," May 2)

Yes, it's sad that some residents found themselves in financial hot water when the mill in town closed. However, that area has had many ups and downs (more downs than ups, really) over the years. In fact, southern Oregon has for generations been dependent on lumber, farming and various agriculture ventures. A tedious economy isn't new; it's practically a way of life.

I suppose I should have been shocked at someone in such dire straits believing Donald Trump can be his savior. But readers should know of the bigotry that permeates the area. Grants Pass, the more populated town nearby, has been a hotbed of racism for many years.

Anyone who grew up believing that it would be possible to find gainful employment and support a family for what could be 40 years before retiring in Cave Junction was probably living in a fantasy world. This article merely underscored the limited vision that might lead someone to cast a vote for Trump.
