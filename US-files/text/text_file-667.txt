To the editor: Thanks to Ann Friedman for calling out the online content users who don’t pay for the journalism and music they regularly enjoy or tip Uber drivers. (“Should we tip online?” Opinion, June 24)

I don’t see how any intelligent, self-respecting person can rationalize that behavior. I am a lifelong newspaper and periodical subscriber and I only read the content online to which I subscribe. I know the day is coming when my daily newspapers won’t be delivered to my doorstep anymore, but I am hoping that day is still a long way off.

In the meantime, I’ll continue to appreciate and happily support the amazing work of journalists, while listening all day to public radio that I also support. And though I don’t have much use for Uber, I most certainly tip the driver anytime I use that service. I can’t imagine not doing that.
