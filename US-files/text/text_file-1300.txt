To the editor: Henry I. Miller apparently thinks it's a good idea to spray plants with an herbicide and eat them. ("GMO food labels are meaningless," Opinion, April 12)

He doesn't mention Roundup-ready crops and the active ingredient glyphosate that is absorbed systemically by the plant. In other words, you can't wash it off. Greater than 90% of corn and soybeans grown in the U.S. are genetically modified not to die from Roundup.

Glyphosate has been patented as a metal descaler, herbicide and potent antibiotic. The World Health Organization has classified it as a probable carcinogen. Small wonder the food industry doesn't want its genetically modified products labeled.
