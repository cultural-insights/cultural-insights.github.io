(“My first L.A. summer with AC,” Opinion, Aug. 7)

I don’t joke about Katrina, Sandy or climate change. Climate-related deaths are happening routinely. Who can miss the climate-induced deluges that destroy towns and lives? True, a lot of people are using their AC more now than ever before, but it’s a reason for us to pay attention to the problem and demand action in Washington.

Now there’s an Op-Ed we need.
