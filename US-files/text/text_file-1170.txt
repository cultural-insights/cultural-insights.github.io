To the editor: Does the City Council in Anaheim have nothing better to do than to consider voting on whether Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump, a national (not a local) candidate, is guilty of divisive rhetoric? ("Anti-Trump resolution 'not appropriate,' says Anaheim mayor," April 26)

Is this really the business of elected city officials?

Maybe they should focus on city business and not waste hours of time that could be better spent.

To the editor: Linda Reedy, a Trump supporter, is quoted as saying says she's “so sick of the anger in this country” and that it's “chilling” and “anti-American” for a government body to denounce Trump for his views.

But apparently it's OK for Trump to make race-baiting and fear-mongering statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslims and to suggest that violence may ensue if he doesn't get the Republican nomination. Add to that his multiple misogynistic comments and derogatory statements about ex-prisoner of war John McCain. I could go on.

Trump's campaign has been the most blatantly anti-American and anger-inducing bid for a presidency in my lifetime of 60 years.
