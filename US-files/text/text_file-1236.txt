To the editor: In the name of fairness, isn't it important to insure that all votes in an election are cast by people who are eligible to vote? Voter ID laws accomplish this objective. ("Proof-of-citizenship registration requirement is blatant voter suppression," editorial, April 15)

If students, minorities and poor people are given sufficient time to acquire the acceptable forms of ID before the election occurs, what's the problem? It is well documented that groups of volunteers transport people who lack the means to the polls. I'm confident these same people are willing to assist those who lack sufficient ID to obtain it.

We live in a free society. As such, people are free not to participate in the election process.

To the editor: The cynicism of Republican-controlled legislatures in 34 states is made clear in Andrew Gumbel's piece on the effects of their voter ID laws.

To disenfranchise 3% or more of a state's voters — obviously mostly poor and mostly Democrats — is so contrary to the strict constitutional principles of democracy otherwise preached by the GOP. Texas accepts gun licenses to satisfy its voter requirements but refuses to accept student ID cards.

Voter suppression laws, just like the recent bathroom gender laws, solve totally nonexistent problems.

When applauding his state's adoption of strict voter ID laws, Pennsylvania Republican House leader Mike Turzai was quoted in 2012 revealing the real motivation: “Voter ID, which is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.”

Too bad the GOP doesn't have enough confidence in its principles and candidates to try and win elections fair and square.
