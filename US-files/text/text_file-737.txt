To the editor: People need to realize that the 6-year-old Choctaw girl removed from a Santa Clarita foster home would not have been with that family for more than four years if it wasn’t for the fact that they kept going to court to try to adopt a child who was not available for adoption. (“A child was taken from her foster parents because she's 1/64 Choctaw. That's cruel,” Readers React, June 16)

The foster family kept delaying reunification with her family in Utah. She also was in contact with her family by Skype weekly and visited them monthly. She is with her sisters now, her own flesh and blood.

The foster parents did not do the job they were asked to do. The Indian Child Welfare Act is not the problem; people who don’t follow the law and the advice of social workers are.
