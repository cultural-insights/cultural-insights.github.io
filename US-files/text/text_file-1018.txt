Journalist and author Jorge Ramos is the voice of Univision and of myriad Latinos here and throughout Latin America. He’s the television reporter whose question about deportations riled candidate Donald Trump, and he’s a formidable voice about and for immigrants – people, he says, who don’t come here “to go to Disneyland. They come here to work.” Ahead of the California primary in a state with a majority-minority population, listen to Ramos on “Patt Morrison Asks.”
