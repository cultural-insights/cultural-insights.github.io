To the editor: Donald Trump does not have a clue. There's politically incorrect, and there's just plain incorrect. ("More chest thumping and zero reason from Donald Trump on his border wall plan," editorial, April 6)

What happened next? Well, it was the fault of those outside agitators, terrible people — bona fide enemies.
