To the editor: The study on drought tolerant landscapes affecting temperatures was interesting. I wonder if the comparison was made only between an L.A. with emerald green, well-watered lawns and the same geographical area with a hodgepodge of xeriscapes.

However, many of us who switched to natives, did so to replace dry, withered grass that has a far different respiration rate than those hypothetical green lawns.

I have no regrets about yanking both front and rear lawns out to plant California native grasses and shrubs. The view out my windows is far shadier and greener now than it has been for years, and I get that for a third of the water used previously.

And did I mention that my time spent on upkeep is a fraction of the old lawn too?

To the editor: Let’s look at the science.

While the study revealed that replacing lawns with drought-tolerant vegetation could lead to some daytime warming, that warming is far outweighed by cooling at night. Nighttime temperature reductions were far greater than the researchers expected.

Drought-tolerant landscaping saves water and provides cooling at night, a greater public health benefit than cooling during the day.

Now, let’s look at the bigger picture. A recent Los Angeles ordinance requires that all new homes and those undergoing major renovation must have a cool roof. Cool roofs reduce daytime and nighttime temperatures—indoors and outdoors.

It follows that a home with a cool roof, coupled with drought-tolerant vegetation, would see significant environmental and financial benefits.
