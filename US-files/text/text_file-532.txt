To the editor: Love is blind. So when it comes to rational gun control it might be helpful to realize that those who oppose it often truly, madly, deeply love their guns. (“Dallas tragedy proves a good guy with a gun shouldn't be the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun,” July 11)

It’s a self-defining, self-affirming and fundamentally irrational relationship like those we have with our lovers, spouses and children.

Any suggestion that these potentially deadly objects of their affection might be anything less than wonderful will be met with the same anger and denial you’d encounter suggesting their lover might be a floozy, spouse a rage-aholic or child a delinquent.

Gun love is blind, and that’s a real problem.

To the editor: George Skelton cites Dallas in dismissing the declaration, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” An op-ed article from a day earlier used the same argument, citing the Orlando shooting and the failure of an armed security person to stop the gunman.

I know of numerous persons killed in cars while wearing seat belts. Using Skelton’s logic above, I can only conclude the proclamation that “seat belts save lives” is “drivel.”

What remains unknown to me is who Skelton will call if he sees an armed intruder approaching his back door. Since he’s concluded a responder with a gun will be ineffective, will it be his lawyer?

To the editor: Edward Allaway killed seven people at Cal State Fullerton in 1976. He stopped shooting when he ran out of bullets. There is no telling how many he would have killed had he had access to detachable magazines.

What more proof do we need to ban detachable magazines and guns that hold more than 10 bullets?
