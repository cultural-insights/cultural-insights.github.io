To the editor: On Tuesday I felt a connection with my mother that I have never felt before. On Tuesday I stood in a small voting booth inside my local polling place wearing an internal badge of honor. (“Clinton claims milestone as first female major-party nominee, wins California primary,” June 8)

I stood there for my mother, who can no longer go to her polling place to vote in person, helping to manifest her dreams, my dreams, that a female – an intelligent, capable, resilient woman – would be elected to the highest office in the land. As I held the ballot marker over the circle next to Hillary Clinton’s name, I said a prayer of thanks to all the women in my life who worked for and aspired to this moment – that I, that all womankind, be given the opportunity to vote for and be represented by someone like us.

On Tuesday I voted for the person who will become the first female president of the United States. On Tuesday I voted for my mother.

To the editor: Once again, as a California resident I feel that my vote doesn't mean anything when the primary gets to this state.

It seems our primary is so late that many potential candidates drop out by the time we vote, leaving only one viable candidate in each of the major political parties. A month or two ago, the respective party nominees were determined and it was over for us. Now we are just waiting for the convention.

My other problem is with the Democratic Party’s system of superdelegates. They determine their convention pick based on their own preference on not by a vote of the people.
