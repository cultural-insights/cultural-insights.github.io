To the editor: Doyle McManus does not mention the fact that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders consistently performs well against likely Republican nominee Donald Trump in nearly every general election poll. ("Polls show Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in a virtual tie. Should Democrats be worried?" Opinion, May 25)

HuffPost Pollster, which averages hundreds of national polls, has shown Sanders beating Trump by more than 10 percentage points since March. They currently show him defeating Trump by about 50% to 39%. Democrat Hillary Clinton, by contrast, beats Trump by about only four percentage points now; she has never enjoyed Sanders’ consistently wide lead.

But hey, what does the synthesis of data from hundreds of sources over a significant stretch of time tell us? For McManus, apparently, not much.

To the editor: I think this hellishly long season of political punditry has finally jumped the shark with the following sentence from the usually insightful McManus: “There’s one big reason Trump is doing better than expected in the polls: Republican voters have rallied behind him faster than some analysts expected.”

So if I understand this correctly, Trump is defying expectations by doing better than expected?
