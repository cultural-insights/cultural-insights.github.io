To the editor: When did vandalism become art?

Calling this woman an artist and referring to an “internationally known graffiti artist” as the “best-known artist” who has tagged in a national park seems to elevate their acts above defacing public property. (Re “Graffiti artist is banned from public lands,” June 23)

Police have too much to do to bring in everyone who has defaced a wall along the freeway, but I'd sure rather see someone out there cleaning up the mess (while wearing a shirt that says “I did this. I'm sorry” on the back) than city employees who have much better things to do.

To the editor: Your article on the destructive graffiti “artists” used that word throughout. These people are not “artists,” they are self-centered destructive vandals and should be recognized as such, rather than have their destruction characterized as art.
