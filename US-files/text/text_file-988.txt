To the editor: I was quite gratified by Nicole Hussey’s piece on pain pills and addiction. ("I use pain medication, but I'm not an addict," Opinion, May 16)

Ever since this national debate on opioid addiction surfaced, I have been dreading the day when many of these medications will no longer be available to those of us who rely on them because of the reckless actions of others. While I sympathize with those who struggle with addiction, I still have to believe that most of us who are under doctor’s care for pain should have a stronger voice here.

Nothing is worse than excruciating, doubled-over, breath-stealing back pain (been there, done that). When the only partial relief comes from taking opioid medication, we can’t start regulating these things out of reach.

Over the years I’ve seen numerous drugs hit the market and then get called back because of abuse or misuse. Where’s the concern for those who are responsible and in need?

I read Hussey’s piece with a heavy heart. I feel for the patients who really need these medications to function.

Lately, the well-publicized and unfortunate deaths from overdose of pain medications have scared the medical community into writing fewer prescriptions, leading to the suffering of legitimate patients. Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon of blaming opioids and the doctors who prescribe them (nevermind that they are licensed doctors who legally prescribed government-approved pharmaceuticals).

If these meds are really that evil and have no place in medicine, why wouldn’t they be outlawed once and for all? Maybe government should do that so the doctors don’t have to say no.

If we don’t like the situation we have now, what are the alternatives? It looks like that for the time being, the legitimate patients who need these meds will suffer. Will there be anyone brave enough to stick up for them?
