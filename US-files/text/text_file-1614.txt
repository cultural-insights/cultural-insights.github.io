To the editor: The sad passing of First Lady Nancy Reagan at the age of 94 brings to mind a better era in the history of our country. ("Nancy Reagan dies in Los Angeles at 94: Former first lady was President Reagan's closest advisor," March 6)

Nancy and Ronald Reagan always comported themselves with the utmost dignity, poise, grace and refinement. Nancy Reagan was always a lady and President Reagan unfailingly a gentleman.

President Reagan surely could not have imagined that we would reach the era in which those who vied to become the leader of the free world would seek to insult their way to the top, bringing into the debate perspiration, urine and sexual prowess. He could not have imagined that the contest in his party would be among a group of men seeking to outdo the others for intolerance and hatred.

As we mourn and remember a first lady of distinction, I also weep for a time in which one could be proud to identify as an American citizen.

To the editor: I was no fan of the Reagans, but looking at the photograph on the front page showing the two of them gazing at each other while dancing, you can see the true love and devotion they had for each other.

Marriage is hard. Five decades of support and caring deserves a high-five regardless of your politics.

Doug Jones, Los Feliz
