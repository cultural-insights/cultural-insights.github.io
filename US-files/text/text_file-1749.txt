There are more than 12,000 chronically homeless people in Los Angeles, living in third world conditions next door to expensive restaurants and first-class accommodations. Most of us turn away when we pass them in the street; we pretend they don't exist.



On Sundays, when the city is quiet, I talk to military veterans, drug addicts and those who are simply too poor to afford housing. I ask them what they desire, what they dream about, what they hope for the future. In my art work, I try to capture this inner life.



I met Birdman under a bridge in Silver Lake, where he'd lived for 20 years. I built him a living room, and then people began to ask to take his picture. Within a week, he shaved and cut his hair for the first time in a decade. Soon after that, he went to a non-profit to get help. Now he lives in supportive housing.



But I'm not a social worker or a drug counselor. I'm an artist who wants people to see their community as it really is.
