To the editor: It's fitting that nonbelievers like humanist Annabelle Gurwitch have found meaningful and inclusive ways to celebrate the time of the year that most American religions call Christmas. ("You don't have to be religious to revel in the holiday season," Opinion, Dec. 17)

After all, it was the pagan “yule” celebration that Christians co-opted and called “Christmastide” nearly 1,500 years ago. Yet many religious conservatives persist in denouncing alternative seasonal celebrations like the annual Atheists United winter solstice gala as evidence of a “war on Christmas.”

Would that we all could get along during this universally special time of the year. Over the next week, shouldn't peace and goodwill to all prevail? Isn't that what the so-called Christmas spirit is all about?

Gurwitch, with her joyful fusion of religious and secular traditions, better demonstrates that ideal than do many self-styled devout celebrants.
