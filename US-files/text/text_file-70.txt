To the editor: Pneumonia is not an “issue.” It’s a diagnosis.

Clinton is not “suffering” from it, she is dealing with it by taking antibiotics.

It is not a “display of weakness.”

We all get it. We all get over it.

( “Clinton health fuels critics,” Sept. 12)

Stop the sexist, exploitative headlines and emotional reporting. Presidential campaigns are grueling schedules that most of us couldn’t keep up with.

To the editor: Lest we forget, some of our most admired presidents have had health conditions, publicly known and unknown, that did not prevent them from being great leaders: Lincoln’s “melancholy,” FDR’s polio, JFK’s Addison’s disease.

Unlike pneumonia, these were all chronic conditions.

Even so, they did not prevent these men from carrying out their duties in exemplary ways.

Across the pond, Winston Churchill suffered several strokes and still led and inspired England.

Let’s not condemn Clinton for a common illness.
