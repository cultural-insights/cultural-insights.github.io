To the editor: The article wrongly asserts that customers of Southern California Edison, among other utilities, have somehow “borne the brunt of failed projects.” (“From useful to wasteful: How utility ratepayers have borne the brunt of failed projects,” June 5)

In fact, Edison, as an investor-owned utility, builds the infrastructure to provide electricity to 14 million people. Shareholders, not customers, made a substantial investment to update the steam generators at San Onofre after almost 30 years of operation. The generators, provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, were faulty, prompting early retirement of San Onofre. Edison is pursuing legal remedies against Mitsubishi.

Customers did not pay for the costs of the defective steam generators once San Onofre stopped operating; shareholders bore those costs, which would have added almost $800 million to rates. Customers will receive 50% of any funds recovered from Mitsubishi.

Most of our utility projects provide customer benefits for decades. Edison’s Big Creek Hydroelectric system, for example, has operated for 103 years. Edison made the initial investment and for many years now, customers, not shareholders, have had the full benefit of that initial investment.

The complexities of providing electricity aren’t easily understood. We believe The Times owes it to its readers to look at the full story of how electricity is reliably delivered to Californians.
