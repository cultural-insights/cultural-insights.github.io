To the editor: Unfortunately, the “bad hair” blues are sung by members of all ethnic groups.

(“The ‘bad hair’ barrier for blacks,” Opinion,

Aug. 24)

I am a Jewish American woman with Eastern European roots, and my sisters had curly hair, so they had it straightened while I, with straight hair, spent hours in my junior high school’s bathroom with my Scandinavian haired friend “teasing” our hair to extremes. I had another friend, a Haitian American with naturally straight hair, who permed her hair so she could look African American.

When it comes to raising kids, I believe it is crucial to instill the greatest sense of pride in all children. We should teach them to set goals and help them attain what they set out to attain. We should help our children shine bright, frizzy hair and all.
