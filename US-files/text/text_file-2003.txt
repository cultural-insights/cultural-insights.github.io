To the editor: Laws are not simply for those who agree with them; they apply to everybody. If you disagree with laws, you should elect representatives who will write or support legislation to change them. That's how it works here in the United States. ("Two weeks in, the Oregon refuge standoff is stuck 'in limbo,'" Jan. 16)

The militiamen occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon are completely delusional, and dangerously so. I believe it is imperative that that these domestic terrorists are vigorously prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

If their form of “protest” against the federal government is legitimized in any way, all of our federal lands and the laws that govern them are seriously at risk.

To the editor: I understand why the federal government wouldn't want to go in and try and force the phony patriots out of Malheur and risk another Waco or Ruby Ridge.

But this refuge belongs to all Americans, and I don't see why the authorities can't block the roads leading to the refuge to keep the occupiers from being resupplied as well as turn off the electricity and turn off the water, if possible.

We can't just wait until these people get bored and leave.

To the editor: Militia leader Ammon Bundy and his buddies want to transfer federal lands to local control? What if the local government is controlled by progressives who do not see things the way they do?

What will they do then? Demand the feds come in and take over? Throw another tantrum and take over another federal building?

Look at the water situation in Flint, Mich. Someone has to be in charge.
