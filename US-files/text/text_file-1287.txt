To the editor: The ridiculous possibility that Leslie Van Houten could be paroled for her participation in the brutal slayings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in 1969 is exactly why there are still so many advocates of the death penalty. ("Board recommends parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten; victim's daughter vows to oppose," April 14)

If “life in prison” doesn't mean exactly that for the murderers of the LaBiancas as well as Charles Manson's other victims, then how can it be considered a reasonable and satisfactory alternative to being put to death?

Attorney Richard Pfeiffer says the following: “The opposition to parole has always been the name Manson. A lot of people who oppose parole don't know anything about Leslie's conduct.”

Van Houten's conduct in August 1969, which included stabbing Rosemary LaBianca at least 14 times in the back and then using her blood to write on the walls, should hopefully be enough to convince Gov. Jerry Brown to deny her parole and leave her to serve out the remainder of her well deserved life sentence behind bars.

To the editor: So let me get this straight: The California parole board recommended the release of Manson associate Bruce Davis last year and, more recently, Van Houten, yet the state still has an active warrant out for the arrest of filmmaker Roman Polanski for something that happened almost 40 years ago and which even his victim said to drop.

Is it the state, the system or both?
