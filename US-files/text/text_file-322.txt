To the editor: How many articles has The Times written about how Donald Trump is dividing the Republican party, and that the divide continues to deepen? (“Republican rift deeps over Trump,” Aug. 3)

When Trump became the major contender as a candidate, the Republican party was dividing. When Trump talked about his plans for a border wall, the party was dividing. When Trump became the presumptive nominee, the party was dividing. When Trump talked against John McCain, the party

was still dividing. When Trump became the official Republican presidential candidate, the party was still dividing.

When can we expect a ruling as to when the Republican party is actually split?
