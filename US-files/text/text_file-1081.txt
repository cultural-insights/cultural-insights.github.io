To the editor: The California Coastal Commission's dealings on the proposed Banning Ranch development in Newport Beach make clear to me that “government of the people, by the people and for the people” is well on its way to perishing from the face of the Earth. ("The animals along California's coast, survivors of droughts and oil fields, have a new foe," May 7)

Politicians and the people they appoint appear free to violate the most fundamental principles of ethics without fear of reproach or sanction. The concept of “public service” has given way to a belief that seeking a position involving “public service” is done solely as a means to private enrichment.

It is enough to make an old man cry.

To the editor: It is disappointing that a member of the California Coastal Commission doesn't know that vernal pools are many things, but they're not “ditches.”

That they are unique for this area can be seen from a part of Pacific Coast Highway right here in Long Beach. They are temporary, important and beautiful.

I hoped people on the commission were educated, knowledgeable and caring about our precious wetlands.
