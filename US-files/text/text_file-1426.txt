To the editor: The sad passing of Patty Duke brings to mind what a remarkable life and career she had. (“Oscar-winning actress: Patty Duke, 1946-2016,” Obituary, March 30)

She was an Oscar winner by an early age, had a very successful television and movie career and was also Screen Actors Guild president. Battling bipolar disorder, perhaps her greatest triumphs were overcoming these issues and bringing successful actor children into the world. She championed mental health issues, helping remove the stigma for many like her.

The definitive “girl-next door” from ‘60s TV will be dearly missed.
