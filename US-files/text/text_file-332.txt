To the editor: In your editorial you make two great, true statements, and one boneheaded one: The answer to “not enough resources” is not to keep building houses but to stop building houses.

The state is telling us we don’t have enough water for current residents. We all can (painfully) see we don’t have enough roads, or parking, or water lines or sewer lines for existing residents. Edison keeps telling me to “save power” because there is not enough to go around — so the last thing we need is more residents.

( “Truck water to the desert? No way,” Editorial, Aug. 1)

No thanks, it is time to draw the line. Until someone creates more water and more roads, let’s stop the madness and declare that we are built out, maxed out.

Raise the drawbridge? You betcha.

To the editor: The Times editorial is absolutely right. Development in desert areas with no local source of water is totally irresponsible and should not be allowed.
