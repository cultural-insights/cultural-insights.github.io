To the editor: I appreciate your editorial supporting the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits 501(c)s from endorsing political candidates. And I like your clarification that it does not prevent sermonizing about or discussing political issues; this should be sufficient argument against claims that the amendment violates free speech rights.

( “Are churches being muzzled,” Editorial, Aug. 14)

The amendment is also consistent with traditional separation of church and state thinking, a cornerstone in our founding fathers’ building the Constitution.

I am happy to participate in a tax system that supports the good services and initiatives churches provide. But I draw the line at those organizations officially endorsing specific political positions, implying that some religious belief is the rationale.

To the editor: When churches have leaned toward one presidential candidate on the other, over the last few decades they've invariably supported the Republican nominee.

Hence GOP leaders now seek to exploit this trend. They view repeal of the Johnson Amendment as a means of boosting their candidates’ support through tax-deductible contributions to churches bent on turning religious services into campaign rallies.

Even where Trump himself is widely suspected of being religiously indifferent, his pitch for such a pious plank in the GOP platform should surprise no one.
