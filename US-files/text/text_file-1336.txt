To the editor: I had such hope for the new Pope. But apparently my wife and I do not reflect “the fullness of God's plan for humanity,” even though she is a physician and I am an educator. ("Pope Francis eases the way for divorced Catholics, but reiterates opposition to gay unions," April 8)

Because our marriage does not have the capacity to “transmit human life,” it is invalid in the eyes of the church; yet, ironically, many of us, including my family, are helping to resolve the abortion conundrum by adopting children. Should my parents' marriage of 65 years be invalidated because they were unable to have children and also adopted?

While divorce and second marriages become increasingly accepted within the Catholic Church and within society as a whole, the now legal marriages of gays and lesbians continue to lie in the balance of these religious fringes. Pope Francis' “care” in recognizing all marriages would not constitute a weakening of faith, but “would be a testimony to the indissolubility of marriage itself.”

It could, inadvertently, aide in keeping marriages — all marriages — together.

To the editor: How nice of the pope to recognize that if the Catholic Church does not stop eliminating parishioners who have been divorced, the church will lose members. On the other hand, in sticking to doctrine against contraception, the church condemns masses of poor people to increased poverty by promoting more births.

The planet is strained and the poor suffer greatly. It is shameful to tell the poorest, who have so little opportunity and support, that God wants them to have children beyond their means and abilities.

This pope has some good points, but he has a long way to go.
