To the editor: The California Coastal Commission was created to protect our beautiful coastline from overdevelopment. This very important goal was supported by Jerry Brown during his first term as governor, or so we thought. I am shocked that our governor has apparently lost his way and appointed pro-development commissioners. ("How dark forces are chipping away at our beloved California coast," Jan. 23)

I am a native Californian and have been fascinated with many of our coastal areas, especially Seal Beach. Who in his right mind would approve a “residential development” on the coast there, especially after the Coastal Commission staff recommended against such action?

The views in Seal Beach are dramatic. Building near these beaches will bring in large construction crews that could block public access.

I have no doubt that the developers will pledge to maintain the pristine environment, but builders have a history of making and breaking promises where business is concerned. Recent history also shows that when new developments come in, the residents want their privacy and seek to close access to the public, something I have always considered exclusionary and illegal.

I hope columnist Steve Lopez continues to follow this proposed development.

To the editor: Evidently, the lobbyists working for coastal developments have no regard for scientists' predictions for the future of the California coast as we now know it.

Perhaps we should encourage them to waste their money to steal the public's beautiful coast, since by 2050 their developments will be swept away by a rising sea. By then, possibly, the coast will be redefined along with the structure of the California Coastal Commission and the selfish energy and development interests.
