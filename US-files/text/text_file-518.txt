To the editor: Although the members of the Police Commission determined that the officers involved in Redel Jones’ death did not violate the department’s deadly force policy, I understand that they and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck were very critical of their actions leading up to the confrontation. (“Amid protests, panel finds that LAPD did not violate deadly force rules in shooting of black woman in South L.A.,” July 12)

Even if you accept the position that no criminal charges are appropriate, I have not heard that any disciplinary action has been taken. I understand that the officers are entitled to the privacy of their personnel records, but the public should be told something.

We are entitled to know that there are consequences for breaches that can set up a tragedy like this. We should not have to accept a “criminal charges or nothing” resolution that too often winds up feeling like a devaluation of the victims’ experience.
