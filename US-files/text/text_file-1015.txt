To the editor: You observe that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has a problem, particularly in the swing states, because he has no local organization and has done nothing to create state organizations that do anything to help the down-ticket races of his party. ("It's not just Paul Ryan who's hard to win over. Donald Trump faces struggle for unity in key states," May 15)

If you change the name to Bernie Sanders, isn’t the situation identical?

To the editor: This article’s headline seems at odds with a recent Quinnipiac poll, which showed Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton neck-and-neck in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.

Toxic Clinton is real. She lost the Indiana primary by only five percentage points without any campaign appearances or money spent on TV ads. It seems the wiser heads in her campaign realized that the 48% would only go down if she campaigned in the state.

Trump needs a teleprompter. Clinton remains fingernails on a chalk board.
