To the editor: The rally in Sacramento that ended up in stabbings was a sad display. (Re “Racist hate groups are evolving,” June 28) The frustration of some of the protesters had come to a head after hearing hate and fear spewed by some of our politicians for years.

Free speech can go too far sometimes.

Being of a minority religion, I have heard this kind of hateful rhetoric long enough. I am not condoning the protesters’ conduct, but when a white supremacist group and a white nationalist group rally and spew their venom, one’s tolerance level explodes.

To the editor: Given the violence in Sacramento involving multiple stabbings, I am surprised we haven’t heard anything from the knife-control crowd. Surely we need background checks to purchase Swiss Army knives and knife sharpeners.



If the knives are big and ugly, we should call them “assault knives” and ban them. And if they spring open in any way by pushing a button, then that too must be prohibited. This should all be relatively simple and we know that no black market for banned knives will occur.
