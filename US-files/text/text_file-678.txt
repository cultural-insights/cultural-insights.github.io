To the editor: Elon Musk's plans look OK to me. I envision my future in the following way: I drive a Tesla electric car, charged by solar panels from Solar City, using batteries supplied by Musk's giga-factory in Nevada. My electricity no longer comes from Edison. (Re “Investors question Musk’s latest proposal,” Business, June 23)

This is all good for everybody, right?
