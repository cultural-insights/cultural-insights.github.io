To the editor: Polling inaccuracies have long been with us. “Dewey Defeats Truman,” after all, was a headline from the 1948 presidential election. (“Why the polls get it wrong,” Opinion, March 27)

Perhaps if less emphasis were placed on polling and election predictions, politicians would be more willing to speak their minds instead of offering prepackaged platitudes based on the ephemeral direction of the political wind currents.
