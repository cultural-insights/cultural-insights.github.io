To the editor: So The Times has come down on the side of dental flossing despite the lack of solid science. (“To floss or not to floss,” Editorial, Aug. 4)

Thank God. We can all smile now with relief.

Not since my third-grade teacher Mrs. Shapiro gave us a short lecture on the Golden Rule (the original Golden Rule) have I had such a public admonishment, and that was back in 1958.

But The Times has made me realize what we’ve been lacking and it has its work cut out for it, what with the lack of personal attention to table manners, driving etiquette, sloppy email behavior, overindulging in carbs, etc.

So carry on, dear friends. Once more into the breach, and then again and again, until all our personal indiscretions are ironed out, science studies be damned.

To the editor: It’s official. The Times recommends a “yes” vote on dental flossing.

To the editor: For the last two generations, medicine has been treated more as a pure science that must depend on evidence-based studies to be acceptable. Two generations of medical students and physicians have been taught to largely ignore the art of medicine and even common sense.

Now we are all paying the price. Every study that is designed for research must have a bias, limitations and exclusions because of the myriad variables.

Flossing studies will be expensive, as is everything else. Limitations will include preexistent medical problems, lifelong diets that affect teeth as well as insufficient vitamin D levels, genetics, regular dental care and even the use of dental tape, which is wider than floss and probably more effective.

Better yet, save our money from evidence-based studies, use common sense instead.

Take responsibility with daily flossing or dental taping.
