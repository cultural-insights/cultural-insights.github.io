Downtown Los Angeles is changing, but Broadway is always an unpredictable show where people from all parts of the city come together. During rush hour everything is in flux. Diamond dealers, artists, Santeria priests, urban cowboys, Skid Row homeless and L.A.’s new gentry suddenly collide.

For the past three years I’ve photographed the characters who live, work or simply walk the sidewalks of Broadway.

These people are the city. I’ve found that whatever you assume about them there’s almost always a little bit more there.
