To the editor? Thank you for calling out the city of Oakland and its partner the California Capital and Investment Group for misleading the public about coal transport being included in their plan for redeveloping an old Army base and their willingness to cause damage to the global environment and potentially the health of nearby residents through their planning decisions. ("If coal is too dirty for the U.S., why would Oakland build a dock to export it to Asia?" editorial, May 9)

Social Studies 101 teaches that the function of government is to protect and ensure the welfare of the people. When that goal conflicts with the wishes of moneyed interests, then public well-being should take precedence. Oakland is forgetting its responsibility not only to its own citizens but the global commons as well, and it needs to be reminded.

The Oakland port, as planned, would keep us firmly on the path of greenhouse gas and pollution-related disasters. It's past time for governments at all levels to fully commit to safe, alternative energy sources and make decisions reflecting that commitment.
