To the editor: After reading various articles on raves in Southern California, I was surprised to find out that medical crews apparently are not routinely available onsite at these events. (“Raves’ problems roam, “ Aug. 3)

When I attended Day on the Green concerts in Oakland during the 1970s, the concert promoter always had medics onsite from the local free clinic to treat overdoses and other health issues among concert goers.

At a minimum, defibrillators should be available at raves.

To the editor: Whether it’s 1970, 1990 or today, the song remains the same: kids want to party.

Communities want to make money.

Everyone in the communities that host these events are saddened by the deaths, but at the end of the day we choose easy answers.

We criminalize drug culture, and leave the making of drugs to criminals who care nothing for the users.

In an increasingly isolating and self-centered media and cultural landscape, young peoples’ desire to find alternative experiences (drugs) will continue to grow.

It shouldn’t be “where do we hold” these events but rather “how do we save lives?”

To the editor: Forget about the146,997 people that you’re going to deny the fun of a summer concert because three people took drugs irresponsibly.

Exactly what do we expect the concert organizer to do about these three people?

This proactive attitude to regulate raves is like banning swimming on public beaches because someone might drown — regardless of the lifeguards on duty.
