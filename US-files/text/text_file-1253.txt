To the editor: It would be helpful to have some context when discussing the Golan Heights, namely how Israel came to capture that area. ("Netanyahu says Israel will never give up the Golan Heights," April 17)

In the months leading up to the Six Day War in 1967, Israeli civilians in the north were subject to numerous attacks from the Golan Heights, which at the time was still possessed by Syria. Israel retaliated and captured the Golan Heights during the Six Day War only after Syria had attacked Israel.

While it is true that Israel launched a preemptive attack on Egypt to begin the formalized fighting of the Six Day War, Israel did not attack Syria first.

Just as Americans would not put up with attacks by its neighboring countries, Israel should be allowed to defend itself as well.

To the editor: For years the Israeli government has made it clear that Israel reserves the right to annex most of the West Bank at a time that suits them â€” likely after most Palestinians are either forced out or corralled in enclaves. That unwillingness to allow Palestinians their right of self-determination is the major barrier to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put the Golan Heights in the same category, making peace with Syria (at some future time when the country is stabilized) impossible.

Both these Israeli positions are contrary to U.S. policy. Yet the United States enables these Israeli policies by it annual military support of more than $3 billion now, scheduled to increase by 50% over the next few years.

If the United States wants to promote peace in the region, ending military support of Israel's territorial expansionism would be a good start.
