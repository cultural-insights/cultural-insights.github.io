To the editor: I am appalled at the celebration of one of the worst financial criminals of the last century, Michael Milken. This thief, the junk bond king, drove the U.S. and world economies down the drain, from which they have never fully recovered. ("Junk bond king Michael Milken looms large in L.A. finance industry," May 1)

The proliferation of billionaires, the rise of homelessness and the destruction of the middle class are all directly related to his Reagan-era and Reagan-enabled financial piracy. His name is a symbol of greed and destruction, his policies anti-democratic, ruthless and predatory, and his firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, an icon of Wall Street criminality.

Yet today Milken is treated as a leader, teacher and benefactor. Shame on The Times for giving him positive ink.
