To the editor: It is no wonder that many in our country feel the criminal justice system is tiered. It seems that some guilty defendants get punished harshly and others receive special treatment. ("As Esteban Nuñez nears release from prison, victim's family remains outraged," April 8)

In the case of Esteban Nuñez — whose sentence for manslaughter was greatly reduced by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2011 at the behest of his father, former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez — the latter is clearly the case.

Schwarzenegger's arguments for his action are ridiculous. Nuñez was just as much a factor in the 2008 death of Luis Santos as Ryan Jett, a codefendant in the case. Apparently, Nuñez was correct when, while fleeing the crime scene, he bragged that his father would come to their rescue.

Unfortunately for the others involved in the crime, they didn't have an “in” with Schwarzenegger.

Because of Schwarzenegger's action, I vowed to boycott any film featuring the former governor. I have not broken this vow, and I never will. I urge others to do the same.

To the editor: I feel there is something we can do about this. We can notify NBC that we will be boycotting the upcoming “Apprentice” show that will feature Schwarzenegger.

The Santos family should know that people care. Its suffering has been made worse by Schwarzenegger's action.

To the editor: I was depressed and outraged after reading about Santos' death and how Nuñez's connections got him a much shorter prison term.

The United States is gradually becoming like a Third World country, where justice is different for the wealthy and the ordinary citizens. What are the options for justice when you don't matter if you can't pull strings?

How do the Santoses survive this double tragedy? Their son died, and they get no justice?
