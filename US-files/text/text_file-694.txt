To the editor: Santa Monica has done a good job of effectively regulating Airbnb use in our city, protecting tenants, neighborhoods, and hotels. (Re “How to regulate Airbnb,” Editorial, June 22)

I am a widow with two grown children who still find themselves in Santa Monica for significant time periods, so I’m not ready to sell my 3-bedroom home. I host Airbnb guests regularly, in strict compliance with city regulations.

Enforcement seems strong: I got a personal phone call from the city inspector, who noticed that I had not listed my business license number in my Airbnb ad, and who then emailed me when she saw I had complied.

In addition to bringing in some extra cash that I can use to repair and maintain my home, I have met some interesting people who have enriched my life. I am able to read reviews of potential guests to be sure they will be good short-term roommates.

Visitors from China, Brazil, and Austria have the opportunity to learn first-hand about American culture, and none could have afforded a hotel room in Santa Monica.

We can’t let Airbnb be a dodge around laws protecting tenants, our affordable housing stock, and the hotel industry. Careful regulation, such as that in Santa Monica, can give us all the benefits of sharing without threatening tenants and hotel workers.
