To the editor: I was very disappointed by your editorial that supported removing Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the federal endangered species list. The article presents an overly optimistic picture of grizzly bear delisting. ("Planning the grizzly bear's return," editorial, April 24)

First, management would be turned over to three states known for extreme hostility to predators. Indeed, these states have already divvied up Yellowstone bears for a trophy hunting season, even though a poll commissioned by the Humane Society of the United States and Wyoming Wildlife Advocates found that 68% of Americans (including 50% of hunters) oppose hunting of grizzlies.

How will the public react when the famous roadside bears of the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone are picked off? Wyoming (the only state to release a management plan) does not provide any buffer zones around the parks or a no-hunt zone connecting the parks. Even the superintendent of Yellowstone National Park has publicly expressed concern regarding the lack of buffer zones for wandering bears.

The plan to delist grizzly bears is premature, risky and incomplete. Grizzlies should remain protected under the Endangered Species Act.
