To the editor: I completely agree with Republican Sen. Jim Nielson of Gerber when he says that “Gun violence is not committed by law-abiding citizens, it is committed by criminals” and that criminals will continue committing crimes with guns even if these new bills become law. (Re “Sweeping gun control package sent to governor,” July 1)

Let’s scrap all of those gun laws. While we’re at it, let’s also get rid of all laws against bank robbery, rape, child pornography and drunk driving since criminals commit those crimes, too, even though they’re illegal. It’s time to make illegality legal. That’s what freedom’s about!

To the editor: Let’s rewrite the first paragraph of this article to bring the rhetoric closer to reality: “Spurred by the opportunity to generate some media coverage for themselves, California lawmakers on Thursday sent Gov. Jerry Brown another package of gun control bills which, if enacted, will join California’s numerous, similar laws in having no significant effect upon firearm-related crime in this state.”
