To the editor: It is a grim outlook indeed for the Republican Party. (“A grim outlook for the state's fractured GOP,” March 27, and “Sanders gets a boost from the West,” March 27)

The front-runner is Donald Trump, a real estate tycoon, a demagogue with no experience whatsoever in public service and who obviously is not a conservative.

In second place is Rafael Edward Cruz (Ted), a conservative senator who helped shut down the government in opposition to President Obama's healthcare plan, who does not get along with his fellow members of Congress because he is not willing to compromise.

And in third place, well behind Trump and Cruz, is John Kasich, governor and a former congressman with actual experience, a proven record and who is willing to reach across the aisle to get the job done — and who even appeals to some Democrats.

Go figure.

To the editor: Am I the only reader who wonders why we had to look deep into the pages of the A section in Sunday's Times to find the article on Bernie Sanders' sweeping victories by huge margins in two Western states?

Has The Times already endorsed Hillary Clinton? I might have missed it.

Anyway, meanwhile the Page One headlines are all about the Republican candidates and their California partisans spiraling to what seems, more and more, to be their inevitable doom led by Donald Trump, who somehow is leading in current polls here. (I thought we were better than that, but that is a topic for another letter.)

Even though our state primary is months away, it would appear it will matter, for a change. In the meantime, let's hear about how Bernie and Hillary do in Oregon, and not inside.
