To the editor: It's ironic that “Budweiser” will now become “America” for a while, since Adolphus Busch originally appropriated the marketing appellation in 1876 from an old beer-naming tradition dating to the 13th century. ("There's no law against Budweiser calling its beer 'America,'" May 10)

Over the course of a century of still ongoing international trademark disputes, Anheuser Busch (now AB InBev) has tried to use its corporate power to bully tiny-by-comparison breweries in the original region into surrendering European rights to the name. Nonetheless, settled cases favor the historical originators to a large degree.

Few Americans know any of this. But try ordering “Budweiser” in Austria, for example, and you'll be drinking European beer. Ask instead for the “Bud” label, and you'll be served the American product.

In light of this history of corporate aggression, the current name change in this country arrives as too little, too late and too temporary.
