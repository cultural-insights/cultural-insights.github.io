To the editor: It would appear that the Senate Republicans’ ongoing obstruction of Merrick Garland’s hearing, as a ploy to preserve their radical agenda, has backfired. (Re “Two in middle tilt high court to the left,” June 29)

The Supreme Court, in its Texas ruling, has sided with the rights and health of women and the will of the American people regardless.

The ruling is a testament that justice and reason can prevail over the dirty tactics and bullying so often employed by Republicans to get their way.

It’s a very good day for the Supreme Court, women and their families, and for America.

To the editor: The current political focus on the U.S. Supreme Court’s dysfunctional eight-member panel only highlights the serious flaws in the way the justices are appointed.



The method of having one branch of government — the executive (i.e. the current sitting president) — pick members of another branch of government (the judiciary) is a serious violation of our constitutional separation of powers and its theoretical checks and balances.

Having the Senate approve the president’s judicial appointees is only a partial protection and leads to the gridlock and political gaming we now are experiencing.

We average citizens would be much better served by a truly independent Supreme Court with staggered appointments of limited terms and not influenced by politicians and their big-business and special interest puppeteers.
