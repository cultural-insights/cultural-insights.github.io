To the editor: The GOP simply spins out of control when it comes to American women and girl citizens and their guaranteed constitutional rights, which I will remind that party again are guaranteed, not iffy. ("Utah abortion bill is reckless meddling into women's health," editorial, April 12)

First, it was all about religion, and when that didn't work, then the GOP spun into the “we're doing this for women's health” excuse, even though those GOP politicians' claims fly in the face of what real doctors say. Now, it's being spun into some unborn personhood and finding more nefarious ways to deny American women and girl citizens of their guaranteed constitutional rights simply because the GOP does not believe American women and girl citizens should have guaranteed constitutional rights.

Supercharging a legal and safe medical procedure with guilt- and shame-inducing rhetoric is abominable. And that's the GOP's only real arsenal in its never-ending war on American women and girl citizens of the United States.
