To the editor: Whether to use lethal means to deal with a brazen coyote is a decision reserved to governmental authorities, and a self-appointed vigilante must pay the price for arrogating that responsibility to himself. (“Mystery shooter kills coyote in Silver Lake,” July 1)

That said, the failure of the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services to firmly address the problem of brazen, habituated coyotes has caused great frustration. One example of this failure is the department’s proposed coyote management plan.

Though the plan recommends several ways to “haze” coyotes, it omits reference to tools such as paintballs and rubber bullets, which cause a transient sting for the coyote and leaves him with an indelible association of humans and physical discomfort. Communities and wildlife experts around the country have embraced these tools as an integral part of a comprehensive, humane coyote management plan.

The department’s approach to managing emboldened coyotes is profoundly deficient.

To the editor: I am a small woman who has had more than a few run-ins with coyotes. Each time, nobody did anything but behave in “awe” or “fear” of these very smart animals.

That is why they do not fear people. We do not give them a reason to.

So now when I run across coyotes, I start them down streets, throwing things at them, running toward them aggressively, yelling, waving my arms. They run away every time.

Coyotes will avoid humans if they fear us. That fear will help to keep our children and pets safe as well as keeping coyotes safe from us.
