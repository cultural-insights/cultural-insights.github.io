To the editor: It’s a shame that The Times didn’t consider education one of the “key topics” to include in this article. The vice presidential candidates’ backgrounds exemplify differences between the parties on this issue. ( “Back Story: Rival platforms miles apart,” July 31)

To the editor: In your ruse “rival platforms” comparison, why did the reporters leave out other topics including: “The Economy,” “Syrian Refugees,” “National Security,” “Law Enforcement” or “Russian Relations”?

Simple, to me: in every one of these topics the Democrats fall woefully short on the logic or the defense behind their positions.

To the editor: Regarding our divided country and platforms, may I comment that Mike Pence, the GOP VP nominee, describes himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.”

Perhaps, if the order was restated to say: “first an American, then a Republican and then a Conservative,” and leave his religion out, we might have more unity; after all, we are not living in a theocracy.
