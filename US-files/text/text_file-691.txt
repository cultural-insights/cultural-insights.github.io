To the editor: On Wednesday, Democrats in Congress led by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia staged a sit-in in an attempt to get a vote on gun legislation. (Re “NRA can’t have it both ways,” Column, June 23) In historic fashion, they shut down the House. The Times hardly covered this event in its print edition.

Television news channels featured live pictures from the House and interviews with members of Congress. I watched some of it last evening, then turned off the television and went to bed. From that time until I wrote this letter, how many Americans will have died from gunshots?

This issue affects many people in our country and you should have given prominent coverage to the House’s efforts to address it.
