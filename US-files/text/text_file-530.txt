To the editor: I agree that the definition of rape must change and I applaud the two California legislators who introduced legislation to do so. (“Recall effort of judge in Stanford rape case gains steam and political allies,” July 8)

I also believe the Legislature should quickly pass tough “social host” laws that give victims the right to hold accountable fraternities, sororities and other organizations that serve alcohol to minors and obviously intoxicated persons. Existing California law should be strengthened to allow victims to seek civil justice against such organizations — including, of course, universities — that serve alcohol without regard to the consequences.

Institutions and organizations that tacitly promote atmospheres of drinking and partying must be held accountable for the shocking outcomes on their campuses.

If we truly want to change the “culture on college campuses where one in five women is sexually assaulted,” then we can start by changing the law.

Our state should be a leader when it comes to these types of legal rights. As a society, we must recognize that the civil courts are sometimes the only real opportunity for sexual assault victims to be heard — and to get true justice.
