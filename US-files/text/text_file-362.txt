To the editor: After his fall for grace (Really, the jump was called “Heaven Sent”?), Luke Aikins said “Nothing worth doing is ever easy.” (“Without a parachute, he’s quite the fall guy,” Aug. 1 )

Well, nothing’s more important than your responsibility to your family — and living up to that responsibility can be hard. What would have happened if you hadn’t been so lucky and had been killed in your childish stunt?

There’s no scientific gain or social good to come from this. This isn’t a teachable moment for your kid, unless what you want to teach is that your puerile impulse is more important than your family responsibilities. No, what’s hard is putting those childish things away and taking care of your family’s emotional and economic well-being.
