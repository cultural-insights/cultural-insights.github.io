To the editor: President Obama forgets that there are millions of legal immigrants living in this country who have painstakingly abided by the rules of entry to come to the USA legally. (Re “Obama to voters: After the Supreme Court ruling, immigration reform is up to you now,” June 23)

My parents lived in a foreign land. They went to the American consulate's office and picked up paperwork for 6 children and themselves. All 6 children had to be inoculated and fingerprinted. Then we had to find an American citizen living in the USA to act as a sponsor. My parents had to show bank account statements and be skilled in an occupation. Everything had to be approved. Then there was the waiting period, based upon the quota system that allows so many people per year from certain countries to enter the USA legally. No, we did not get on a plane come here as a visitor or pretending to be a student and then stay and overstay our welcome, neither did we walk across the border. We waited in line for our turn, over 5 years.

To the editor: “The Constitution is clear,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. “The president is not permitted to write laws — only Congress is."



I almost choked on my coffee on when I read that little gem. Given the GOP's record congressional obstruction during the age of Obama, Ryan's true calling obviously isn't in the legislative arena, it's in stand-up comedy.
