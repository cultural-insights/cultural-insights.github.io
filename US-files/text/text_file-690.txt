To the editor: On the front page, we learn that our forests are a “catastrophic” fire risk because of massive tree die-off. (Re “A ‘catastrophic fire risk’ ’’ June 23)

The editorial page politely warns us that we still need to conserve our water.

The last few years have seen record rises in global temperatures. The once-frozen and impenetrable Arctic sea is now an open passage. Animal species are dying in record numbers.

Oil, gas, coal and other mining interests are gouging the Earth for its natural resources and leaving waste in their wake. Our oceans and its inhabitants are dying.

It is plain as day that we, the surviving human species, have managed in just a few hundred years to destroy planet Earth. We have run out of time.

The ironic thing is that this planet will survive as it has through massive changes over billions of years. However, for humans and life as we know it, the change will be forever.
