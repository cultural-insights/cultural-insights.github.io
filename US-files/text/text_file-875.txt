To the editor: Megyn Kelly is another face in a decades-long conga line of celebrity journalists queuing for their close-ups. (“After a big year, Fox's Megyn Kelly could command $20 million — but would her success carry to another network?” May 31)

Moreover, Kelly is hardly “the first breakout anchor talent in recent years,” as this article states. Awaiting her on Mt. Rushmore is ubiquitous Anderson Cooper, who had his own syndicated talk show, has published two memoirs, appears regularly on “60 Minutes” and does everything at CNN (including co-hosting its annual New Year’s Eve telecast) but dance on the walls and ceiling like Fred Astaire in “Royal Wedding.”

The bigger point, unmentioned in this article, is the danger Kelly’s geysering fame represents: a further lifting of the messenger above the message, with journalists in many cases eclipsing the stories they cover and subjects they interview. That’s certainly true of Kelly as she adapts to the crushing burden of fame.

As for her future, don’t rule out “Dancing with the Stars.”
