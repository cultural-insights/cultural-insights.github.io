To the editor: Bill and Hillary Clinton have always been plagued by questions about their ethics, and it is hardly a surprise that the FBI inquiry uncovered serious problems with the famous e-mail server. (“Trump and Clinton are giving people lots of reasons to vote against them,” July 7)

Clintonian troubles seem to surface every few years, an issue that would no doubt continue to unsettle a Hillary Clinton presidency from time to time.

In sharp contrast, likely Republican nominee Donald Trump’s ethics are clear for all to see.

With an empire built atop strategic bankruptcies, unpaid contractors, fraudulent claims and unfounded lawsuits, we can be confident that if he were elected, we would be in for four years of unbroken and unparalleled malfeasance, capped by a quick exit before the chickens came home to roost.

To the editor: Mass media that did not exist when America was born are now on the leading edge of the country’s demise.

Do you choose Clinton, whose past raises questions of her trustworthiness? Or do you pick Trump, who came into national awareness by virtue of a TV show?

It’s too early to tell who the winner will be, but it’s safe to say the unanimous loser will be America.

To the editor: Between Clinton’s e-mails (and other scandals) and Trump’s Baja California condo promotion (and other scandals), the American public can rest assured that despite the partisan divide, our two presumptive presidential nominees have one great thing in common: Neither has a problem misleading the public when it suits him or her.

Good luck, America.
