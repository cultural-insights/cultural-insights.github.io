To the editor: Two articles in your paper present an interesting juxtaposition of life in the greater L.A. area.

( “A spire to climb,” Sept. 4, “L.A. still waits for 100-story tower,” Sept. 4, and “An uncertain prognosis for L.A.’s pumas,” Sept. 4)

In one article, we learn of the towering Wilshire Grand. In another story, we learn that the future of the pumas in our area is threatened by the absence of a wildlife corridor. Surely, if we can build a gigantic tower in downtown L.A., for whatever materialistically driven reasons, we can muster the resources to put together a wildlife corridor to preserve these wonderful animals.

Really, it can be done. We just need to set our minds, priorities and resources to do it.

To the editor: So the 73-story Wilshire Grand replaced the Library Tower as L.A.’s tallest.

But the Library Tower holds thousands of stories (in print, like other libraries) although they don’t contribute to its height.

To the editor: Nice try, but, you can’t just shove a broomstick into the top of your building and then get to claim, “My building is taller than your building!”
