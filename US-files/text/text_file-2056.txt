The year 2015 was not a red-letter year for police and some of the communities they serve. In city after city, the names of people killed by police or dying in custody were chanted like battle cries by protesters: Eric Garner in New York, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Laquan McDonald in Chicago, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Ezell Ford in Los Angeles. Here in L.A., police shootings just about doubled from 2014, and crime rates rose after a years-long lull.
