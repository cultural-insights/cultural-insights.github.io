To the editor: No, Donald Trump’s invitation to Russia to disclose hacked emails from Hillary Clinton does not rise to the level of treason. But it does rise to the level of disgusting politics and psychodrama. (“Democrats see a silver lining in an email release,” editorial, July 26)

I would hope GOP leaders do everything publicly they can to walk away from their candidate. They need to retain some seats in Congress to maintain an effective two-party system. If Republicans who love this country don’t speak up now, they should not call themselves patriotic Americans, for they will have endorsed the thought that foreign countries should investigate our citizens and our leadership.

Trump has crossed the line of decency and honor. He just flunked his civics test.

To the editor: The front-page article would be laughable if it were not so naive and incorrect.

Trump didn’t dare Russia to spy on us; they’ve been doing it for 80 years. Clinton dared the Russians when she set up a private server as secretary of State for the world to hack.

Trump is pointing out that we can’t see the emails because Hillary deleted them. So why not ask the Russians to share what they may already have? The uproar implies that there is classified and damning info, but how do you hack an already shutdown server?

Trump stole the spotlight because he is smarter than Clinton and The Times.
