Sen. Barbara Boxer’s decision to retire has given California its first open U.S. Senate seat in more than two decades. Apparently there are a lot of politicians and wannabe-politicians who've been waiting in the wings. Some 34 candidates want to replace her – giving voters the longest list of contenders in a single race since 135 people ran in the special election to recall Gov. Gray Davis.

So who are all these men and women who think they should be one of two people elected to the U.S. Senate representing the most populous, most economically significant and, dare we say, most important state in the nation? And how did they end up on the ballot?

California’s top-two primary allows virtually anybody to get on the June ballot. Candidates have to pay the $3,480 filing fee or submit 10,000 valid signatures – no political party nomination required. That helps explains the size of the field and the eclectic mix of candidates.

The Times Editorial Board attempted to talk to and research the candidates. As part of the board’s endorsement process, we reached candidates who listed a phone number or email address with the secretary of state’s office. Of those, 21 accepted our invitation for an interview, either in person or by phone.

Most of the candidates we spoke with have never run for nor held public office before. Few thought they have a serious shot at becoming California’s next senator, but they saw the race as an opportunity to get publicity for themselves or an issue they care about. Some wanted to rail against the political establishment and bring some common sense from the common man to D.C. Almost all were surprised and disappointed that they have to share the ballot with 33 other people.
