To the editor: Reporter Mark Barabak’s incisive analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic president nomination misread his message. Barabak wrote, “Sanders, for all his talk of political revolution, apparently isn’t holding out for that either.” (“Bernie Sanders never came close to beating Hillary Clinton. But here's why his campaign still mattered,” June 17)

Sanders said he is in this campaign beyond just the election as the leader of the progressive movement. The election has already produced unprecedented change, and more is coming. Sanders’ negotiations with the Democratic hierarchy will tell the tale. This year, many Americans awakened and mobilized, building movements inside and outside both political parties.

It would severely damage the Democratic Party to marginalize Sanders. What he does with the power he has acquired is enormously important. As he has stated, defeating likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is essential, but not without the Democratic Party concurring substantially with his terms and conditions for support.

To the editor: Sanders also didn’t get, and perhaps still doesn’t, that the superdelegates had already vetted Clinton from the 2008 race and her work before.

While Sanders may have left his mark on the Democratic race this primary, Clinton has left hers over the last 30 years.
