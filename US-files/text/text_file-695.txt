To the editor: Author Matt Welch may edit a magazine called Reason, but he is curiously bereft of it. (Re “Escaping to Canada?” Opinion, June 20)

He casually, unnecessarily and erroneously throws barbs at both Hillary Clinton and President Obama.

In what should be a pure comic piece, he is compelled to attack our president for something the Republican-majority Congress has instituted. This is the primary strategy of the Republicans, who have done nothing about “jobs, jobs, jobs” or anything to move America forward in any way since gaining the majority in Congress.

I was enjoying this op-ed until the hidden poison in it made me sick. Maybe this contributor should go to Canada and stay. Hillary will be president here and obviously he will not approve. Oh, wait! Canada is even more liberal.

To the editor: I had tears in my eyes with uncontrollable laughter. Your sentence, “But would-be expatriates, whether fleeing Generalissimo Trump or Hillary Peron,” was a gem!

Thank you for injecting some humor in this Machiavellian insane election.
