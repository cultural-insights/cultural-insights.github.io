To the editor: Steve Lopez's column mocking those who are getting more and more interested in Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was fun. ("President Trump and California: a beautiful union, believe me," April 30)

Trump is a bully, he's too outspoken, he's not a racist (what part of “illegal” don't you understand?), he demeans as a tactic, he brags, he speaks without too much thought at times — all of the above are true.

But if you want just one small indication of why so many are interested in him, just read the article in the same day's paper about California politicians receiving free tickets to sporting events. It is so indicative of today's career politicians.

I, like so many others, want term limits and don't want career politicians. If it will take a Trump to get that ball rolling, then so be it. We are angry with our politicians, angry with pundits, angry will the liberal media, angry with Hollywood's influence — the list goes on.

You didn't listen all these years. Trump is the result. Sad, but true.

To the editor: Lopez's column gave me laughs — I mean, huge, horchata-out-the-nose laughs.

Lopez, funny guy — where'd you find him, Tijuana? I jest. Probably one of the decent ones. Sends money home to his parents, am I right?

Beautiful article, absolutely the most beautiful. Believe me.
