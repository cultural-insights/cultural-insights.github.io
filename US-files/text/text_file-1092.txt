To the editor: Dan Schnur posits a provocative idea of California Republicans running their own third-party candidate in the fall. But the point should not simply be to send a message, but to win the White House. ("Distancing itself from Trump's toxicity could be the California GOP's salvation," Opinion, May 5)

If there was ever a year in which millions of voters are looking for a positive alternative to the two probable nominees, this is that year. A serious and viable conservative ticket could promise to govern as Republicans if elected and could remind the voters and the media that in a three-way race, the winner needs to gain only 34% of the vote.

If everyone believes that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is going to lose anyway, this candidate could be seen as a chance for anti-Trump voters to redeem their pride and not simply vote for a spoiler.

But someone is going to have to step up, and quickly. Supporters of #NeverTrump should do everything they can to stop Trump before the convention while also planning a truly independent conservative ticket.

To the editor: Schnur proposes to engineer an independent candidate into the California ballot in addition to Trump and either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders to satisfy the many Republican voters who feel uncomfortable with Trump as their only choice.

Such an “independent” candidate would interestingly be pro-immigration, pro-choice and pro-international trade. Is this a straightforward proposal simply to offer a safe harbor to Republicans uncomfortable with Trump?

Of course not. The Schnur scheme would divert a large group of Republicans from voting for Clinton or Sanders.

The GOP primary is effectively over. Having more than 10 candidates assured a fair choice.
