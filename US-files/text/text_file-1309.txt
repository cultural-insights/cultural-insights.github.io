To the editor: When Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, it will be a truly revolutionary event. ("It will take a miracle for Bernie Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton. And that's OK," Opinion, April 10)

It will say to American young women and girls, “Yes! The final glass ceiling is shattered and you can grow up to be anything you want, including president of United States.”

You can imagine the message Clinton's win will send to women and girls around the world — to the women in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Central America and India: “Yes! The leader of free world is a woman. Yes! The commander in chief of biggest military force is a women. Yes! She worked all her lifetime for women's and children's rights — and she won for all of us.”

To the editor: Doyle McManus writes that it will take a miracle for Bernie Sanders to beat Clinton, but that's OK.

As a millennial woman, I tend to see things in less hyperbolic and religious framing.

With polls showing Clinton's popularity dropping across the nation, an FBI investigation still hanging over her head and an inability to connect with my generation (some of whom, by the way, are now in their 30s and have children of their own), I think it is more likely that Clinton needs divine intervention to secure a once seemingly pre-ordained nomination.

To the editor: With his recent “win” in Wyoming, Sanders now needs to get 1,314 of the remaining 1,938 Democratic delegates. This is about 67%.

From now on, every time Sanders “wins” a primary or caucus with fewer than 67% of the delegates, he falls farther behind the power curve. That means he will have to win an even greater percentage of the remaining delegates.
