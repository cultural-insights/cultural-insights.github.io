To the editor: Thank you, Los Angeles City Council, for recognizing the urgent need to provide a wildlife corridor in the Santa Monica Mountains from Griffith Park to the 405 Freeway. But why stop there? ("Ensuring public access for pumas in the Santa Monica Mountains," editorial, April 26)

Wildlife has been crossing the Mulholland bridge over the 405 for many decades. Why not extend the length of the wildlife corridor along Mulholland Drive west to the city boundaries? The county is considering a proposal to make the Mulholland wildlife corridor a Significant Ecological Area.

The city is ahead of the county in taking action. Hurray for it.

To the editor: We're the only house on our block in Laurel Canyon that lets the wildlife through. We wish more people did it. The houses around here are getting bigger, open lots that served as de facto wildlife corridors are being developed, and Waze has cars racing through our streets.

Homeowners should love the wild animals as much as their dogs.
