To the editor: The whining, complaining and fear-mongering about the high-speed rail passing near homes, schools, ranches and other places is a poor reflection on our narcissistic generation’s responsibility to build its share of infrastructure. ("Horse owners in the San Fernando Valley feel trod on by bullet train," May 23)

In Japan, bullet trains hurtle through crowded cities and towns, along spectacular coastlines and through long tunnels.

Bulletin: Trains are fun, especially to children. I recall watching a nephew’s soccer game in Massachusetts as a commuter train rattled by and the kids’ attention was instantly riveted on the passing train.

People kvetching are bad enough, but now we’re worried about our horses? The Shinkansen in Japan and the TGV in France, to name just two high-speed systems, streak through idyllic countryside with postcards villages and, yes, horses, cows, sheep and other animals that seem to be doing just fine.

People adapt; even horses adapt.
