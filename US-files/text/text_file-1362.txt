To the editor: I am hopeful that with this conviction of former Los Angeles County Undersheriff Paul Tanaka and the change of leadership at the Sheriff's Department, I can experience closure from my haunting memories as a juror more than 15 years ago. ("Tanaka convicted on conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges," April 6)

I recall so vividly a mentally ill, fully shackled, mumbling black young man, rocking back and forth at the defense table, accused of beating eight healthy, clean-cut sheriff's deputies. Prosecuting him was clearly a waste of time and money, and I expressed to the court that my primary concern was how we were using our common resources. Other jurors expressed their inability to serve on similar grounds.

I continue to be troubled by the answers about “everyone doing their job.” Hopefully the corrupt and sociopathic strain in the leadership of the Sheriff's Department of that era will be no more. I can only hope.

Avis Ridley-Thomas, Los Angeles
