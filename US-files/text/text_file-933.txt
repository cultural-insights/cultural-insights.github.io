To the editor: I was so moved by the well-written article on how two cultures of immigrants in Orange County — Latino and Vietnamese — work so hard to achieve some degree of success in America. ("In Little Saigon, some Latinos are learning Vietnamese to get ahead," May 24)

To be sure, the Latino community struggles immensely to find satisfying work. I am very proud to live among both communities and marvel at their zest and determination to reach a meaningful livelihood and contributing to the making of a great America.

This piece was so enlightening and inspiring to read — a far cry from the sad story of a senseless death of a young Vietnamese woman in a street argument outside a Santa Ana night club last year, leaving one to wonder if the Latino and Vietnamese communities can ever live and work together. This article answered that question beautifully.

To the editor: The article features Roberto Torres, who has worked in the same Vietnamese restaurant for 25 years.

By all accounts he’s an exemplary employee: He learned to speak some Vietnamese, observes the Vietnamese customs, works a split shift seven days a week, takes every shift assigned to him and hardly ever takes sick days. He rose from dishwasher to head waiter.

The clincher: He earns $10 an hour. After 25 years on the job.

This is Exhibit A as to why we need government intervention to set the minimum wage.
