These are The Times' endorsements for the June 7 primary. The Times endorses selectively; these recommendations do not cover every race on every Californian’s ballot. Voting by mail is underway.

In the presidential race, voters select from candidates running for a particular party nomination; winners of each party nomination will compete in the Nov. 8 general election.

In the Senate and House of Representatives contests, voters may select any candidate on the ballot regardless of party affiliation. The top two vote-getters will compete in the general election.

In nonpartisan races, including the district attorney, county supervisors and the Superior Court judge races, candidates who win more than 50% of the vote are declared the winners and will avoid November runoffs. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off in the November election.
