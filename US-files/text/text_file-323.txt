To the editor: As a person living with cancer, I found The Times’ article about Robert Stone’s decision to utilize California’s End of Life Option Act both relevant and poignant. (“Choosing when to meet death,” Aug. 3)

I applaud his willingness to share his story so that others might learn that they do have a choice when it comes to dealing with end of life issues.

I plan to emulate Stone when my time comes and knowing that choice is available brings me a great deal of comfort. As for those who oppose the right to choose, don’t avail yourselves of the option. It’s that simple. Just don’t attempt to deprive others of their right.

To the editor: Thank you for this good article. At least there’s a conversation going on.

I get so tired of people who are against assisted death. Nothing has changed for them, they are free to do what they want.

Trouble is, they want to force those of us who would like an option if the time comes, to be without that option.
