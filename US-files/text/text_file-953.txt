To the editor: Breathing heavily as if it was a shocker, The Times gave us a front-page recap of the extramarital bedroom antics of Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. ("Donald Trump sees political gain in Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs," May 21)

When will America and The Times grow up and realize that cheating by politicians is nothing new and no big deal? As a breed, they lust for approval, admiration, power and conquest, and their roll call of adulterers includes Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Gary Hart, Eliot Spitzer, Newt Gingrich, Nelson Rockefeller and lots of others.

The French are much more rational about hot pants in high places. After President Francois Mitterrand died, his wife invited his mistress to grieve with her at the funeral. France shrugged.

To the editor: As your article states, Clinton cheated on his wife; so did Trump, Gingrich and former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.).

But only the Clintons smeared the names of the women who stepped forward to accuse the president. Monica Lewinsky was a thong-wearing stalker, and Hillary Clinton referred to her as a “narcissistic loony toon.”

Anyone who listens to Monica Lewinsky’s TED talk could not possibly vote for Hillary Clinton.

To the editor: It appears nothing is risky for Trump. The media let Trump off the hook for lie after lie after lie, insult after insult after insult.

The media have let the citizens of this country down. We still know almost nothing of Trump’s policy positions. Trump always wants a break; how about giving the people of this country a break?
