To the editor: I applaud our various local police forces for all the good they do on a daily basis. Unfortunately, because of some bad apples, at times I have to question the motivation and morality of their behavior. ("A top L.A. sheriff's recruit was just days on the job when he says deputies beat an unresisting inmate," May 17)

I want to thank ex-Deputy Josh Sather of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for doing the right thing and testifying against two former colleagues who were convicted of charges related to the beating of a jail inmate.

This article reinforces both my praise and criticism for the police. Perhaps if we had more deputies like Sather, I would have complete faith in law enforcement.

To the editor: And there are people who wonder why so many people of color distrust law enforcement? Can this beating be one of many reasons?

The lies these officers tell and the coverups are obvious, and the willingness of others to believe officers who have committed crimes against the people they are sworn to protect — while their chiefs, commanders, captains, police unions, commissions and lawyers defend them and adhere to their code of silence — says a lot about these thugs in blue.

To the editor: Each time I read about beaten inmates, I wonder about the hiring and training of police or guards. It seems that some of them are eager to take the opportunity to release their impulses for aggressive cruelty.

Are guards and police hired without regard for their violent urges? Aren’t they trained not to beat up prisoners?

I hope someday soon our corrections system will emulate the German model, which treats it as rehabilitation.
