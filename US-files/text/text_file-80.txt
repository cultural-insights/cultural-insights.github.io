To the editor: Santa Ana is not the only place the homeless are a big problem and getting worse by the month.

Costa Mesa's parks have become all-day-encampments that make some of them uninhabitable.

Children are not safe to play at many local parks, including one that sits across the street from a police sub-station. Businesses are beleaguered with the homeless.

( “At Santa Ana Civic Center, an encampment problem,” Sept. 6)

I think Prop. 47, which reduced penalties for some nonviolent crimes, probably needs revisiting— since city leaders and police seem unable to deal with the growing problem.

To the editor: It appears to me as though the immigrants being granted asylum in California are faring a bit better than the swelling number of homeless, whose rise in numbers is causing the city of Santa Ana to declare a public health crisis.

Maybe our homeless should be offered beds before we accept any more immigrants?
