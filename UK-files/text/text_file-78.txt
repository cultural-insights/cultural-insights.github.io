After the return of peace, children will be no longer spoken of as “encumbrances”. We shall at least have learnt this from the hot breath of destruction which has swept away so many of our best and bravest.

With more work than ever to be done, and with those who would have done it lost by the hundred thousand, or living maimed, we must conserve the human forces which spring to birth. The checking of infant mortality, the national care of children that they may grow up in sound physical health, as well as moral, will be, or ought to be, an object second to none.

On motherhood and childhood the future of the nation rests and the dreary doctrine of laissez-faire must be swept away. It must be recognised that the care of children is a duty of the state; that it is not sufficient to protect them from gross neglect, but that they must be protected against ignorance as well. The resources of knowledge must be placed at the disposal of those who have care of them and means found to coerce those who will not make use of that knowledge. Misused though it is as a cloak for apathy, we yet cling to the conception of parental responsibility. Only tact and effort can reconcile that with the responsibility of the state.
