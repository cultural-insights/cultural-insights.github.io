That is the grim puzzle that faced the party at its annual conference this week in Brighton. That sad event was a stark reminder of how sharply political fortunes can turn. A party that two years ago shared power in the coalition government has been reduced to a demoralised rump, struggling to fill its meeting-rooms. 
Some of the Lib Dem malaise can be explained by recent history. The party is still paying the price for a deal with the Conservatives that angered some of its Left-leaning backers. Infamously breaking a promise not to raise tuition fees still costs the Lib Dems dearly in university towns where Jeremy Corbyn’s silly idealism is lauded. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, also bears some responsibility. Not only does he lack real charisma, his judgment is dubious: his conference speech was a soft-Left appeal to Labour voters, an approach already attempted with no success by  Mr Corbyn’s internal opponents.
Overall, things look bleak for Mr Farron’s party. But are the Lib Dems doomed? Not necessarily. The political tremors of the Brexit vote are still being felt; the party system remains in flux. If the Lib Dems chose to take the part, a sensible centre-ground party could yet play a significant role in Britain’s post-EU politics.
