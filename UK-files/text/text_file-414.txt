This week, host Jessica Valenti talks about the choice to live without having children – and the stigma women face in making that decision.

Valenti is joined by Meghan Daum, author of Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids and author Danielle Henderson, a TV writer for HBO’s Divorce and Hulu’s Difficult People and creator of the Tumblr account Feminist Ryan Gosling.

They touch on work-life balance, reclamation of bodily autonomy and “Satanic panic”.
