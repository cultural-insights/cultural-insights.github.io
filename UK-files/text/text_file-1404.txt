Britannia was not only culled to save money, it was also undone by a Labour government with little sympathy for the monarchy. That was a mistake. British republicans might resent the monarchy, but the Royal family are a diplomatic gift, with a popularity and reach that prime ministers can only envy. They are also a magnet for tourism and inward investment. As such, a royal yacht could serve as an embassy for trade talks and a floating promotion for British technology.
This is another example of the possibilities opened by Brexit. While the European leaders thrash about from crisis to crisis – bound by no clear sense of identity and increasingly aware that their voters are troubled by a loss of sovereignty – Britain has the chance to strengthen its global position. Team GB’s performance in the Olympics has shown what a nation that fosters talent is capable of. The resilience of the economy underscores our essential strengths. The royal yacht would represent a nation that is at once keenly aware of its past while investing wisely in the future. It is time to put it back to work.
