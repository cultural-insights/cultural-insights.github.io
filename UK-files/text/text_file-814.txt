Taking a brief break in their fight for independence, Catalans have turned their activism to a different cause: the fight to have the word porrón recognised as an emoji.

A porrón is a jug that facilitates the communal drinking of wine – George Orwell was not a fan, describing it as a “dreadful thing”.
Seven hundred Catalans disagree with him, however, and have signed a petition for it to be represented in emoji form. Here are some other words that could make nice emoji additions.
Kummerspeck
The German term Kummerspeck denotes weight gain from emotional overeating – its literal translation? Grief bacon. Grief bacon. The bacon emoji has already been approved by the industry’s Unicode consortium for the next update, so perhaps Kummerspeck would combine it with a sad face.
Litost
While not a Milan Kundera coinage, the Czech author’s definition of the term is widely accepted: “A state of torment created by the sudden sight of one’s own misery.” The perfect emoji would be the face with bead of sweat hovering above a chaise longue.
L’esprit de l’escalier
This literally means “stairwell wit” and I know it well: thinking of a great retort too late, once one has left. I think I’d like this to be a sad or frustrated looking clown.
Halatnost
In English, “dressing gown-ness”. This wonderful Russian word sums up time spent lounging around, undressed, watching Netflix and not really getting out of bed.

Bilita Mpash
A rainbow over a pillow could represent this Bantu phrase that means an amazing dream, the opposite of a nightmare.
Potiskat
You know the hug you give your cat because you love it so much you might break it? The Lennie-style hug? This is what Russian potiskat is: to hug aggressively. It’s better than the cat with hearts for eyes. 
Ostalgie 
Nostalgia for East Germany. (Who knew?) In emoji: fragment of Berlin wall with a graffiti heart.

Cavoli riscaldati
Literally meaning “reheated cabbage”, this is an Italian term for having another crack with an ex-partner. Perhaps this doesn’t need its own emoji on second thoughts. This should never be encouraged.
Ilunga
Voted the most difficult word to translate into English, ilunga, which is a Tshiluba word (spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), refers to a person who will forgive abuse or wrongdoing a first time, tolerate it a second, but never a third. It’s probably even harder to translate into an emoji.
Ya’arburnee
At first glance, this is depressing. An Arabic term which means “may you bury me”, it actually refers to a wish to die before one’s partner, because life would be too painful without them. I’m not sure that sentiment should ever be expressed by WhatsApp, however. Stick with flowers from the local garage like the rest of us.
Bakkushan
This emoji would be an instant signal to avoid a guy, a bit like the aubergine emoji followed by the question mark is currently. 🍆 ❓ Why? Because this Japanese term means “a woman who appears attractive from the back, but actually isn’t”. *eye roll emoji*.
Seigneur-terraces
Another French term. This refers to people who spend hours in a cafe but hardly any money. The emoji could be an east London hipster working on his startup plans, or a rendering of pre-Potter JK Rowling. Or me, writing this piece.

Sobremesa
After-dinner chatter. This would be a coffee cup with a speech bubble rising from it. (Sobre actually means “over” and mesa means “table” in Spanish). 
Schlimazel
The Yiddish word for a chronically clumsy or unlucky person could be represented by the walking man falling into a pothole. 
Hanyaku
A Rukwangali word (a Bantu language spoken in Namibia) which means “to walk on tip-toes in hot sand”. Unclear whether this would be better illustrated with an emoji, or just iMessaging a photo of your mum on holiday.
Mudita
There’s no doubting Apple, Google et al would have to get creative with this one, but it is lovely. Mudita is a Sanskrit word which means the opposite of the German term schaudenfreude; that is, taking pleasure in another’s success.
