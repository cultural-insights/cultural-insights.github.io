The last word today goes to Owen Jones, who looks forward to the weekend and asks what yours might have in store. Thank you for joining the discussion today!



It’s been quite the turbulent year, to say the least. From deaths of beloved celebrities to the Labour party turning in on itself to Britain leaving the EU, it’s been, um, quite the rollercoaster. So this Bank Holiday is a good chance to try and forget about it all. I’m off to Reading and Leeds Festival where I’ll be mostly wandering around feeling old. What are your plans?
