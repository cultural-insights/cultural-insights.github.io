After more than a year, during which the evidence has mounted, Angela Merkel has finally taken a small step towards acknowledging something that has been apparent to others from the start: her decision to throw Germany’s doors open to unlimited numbers of migrants from the Middle East and Asia was a mistake of historic proportions. 
That it has taken several electoral setbacks at the hands of the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to bring Mrs Merkel to this point says a great deal about her obduracy. The German Chancellor’s stubborn refusal to accept that, contrary to her cheery slogan, Germany cannot cope with an influx of more than 1 million newcomers may yet undo the woman who once stood unchallenged as Europe’s paramount leader. It has also amplified the anger on which the AfD has fed, allowing the far-Right to return to the German political stage.
