In Frances Ryan’s Hardworking Britain column each week, she focuses on stories of individuals who are affected by government policy, including the austerity agenda, which has led to a reduction in welfare spending over the past six years.
One key area affected by government policy is housing. Cuts to housing benefits and other support services mean more people are being forced to live in temporary accommodation, with figures last year showing a 308% rise in families living in B&Bs since 2010 in England. There are also reports of people being priced out of city centres, and moving elsewhere. 
Are you living in alternative accommodation due to high rents or a lack of financial support? Did you move in with friends or have you spent time sofa surfing? Or are you and your family living in a B&B or shelter? If you have a story you’d like to tell as part of the Hardworking Britain series, let us know in the form below.
