It’s Friday (hoorah!) and some of you might be going to the cinema in the coming days. As a new Blair Witch Project film hits our screens, assistant opinion editor Toby Moses writes about commissioning Heather Donahue to write about her experience.

1999 may not seem that far ago – well not to those of us over 30 anyway – but much has changed, not least the ubiquity of the internet. The world wide web existed back then, although it wasn’t always with us, in our pocket, shrieking at us from our phones. It’s in that context that the hype for the original Blair Witch Project should be remembered – it’s almost inconceivable that a marketing campaign which hinges on suggesting to the public that the events contained in a horror film are real could succeed now, when a simple Google would reveal the actors’ digital footprint for all to see. Which makes Heather Donahue’s experience rather unique – star of a smash film, but in hiding so that nobody will know she is in fact an actor, and is in fact very much alive.

With the reboot out this week it was a pleasure to get her perspective on the phenomenon – and while I was never the biggest fan of the original (absolutely chilling final shot aside) it has certainly whet my appetite for this new Blair Witch.
