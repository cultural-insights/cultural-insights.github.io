The problem, as is so often the case with such investigations, is that the limited purpose for which it was established has been hijacked by those who would do harm to the reputation of our Armed Forces and, as a result, has got completely out of hand. No other country in the world is putting its servicemen and women through this sort of legal process, so why are we? We report today how a former Army captain commended for her work in Iraq was dragged from her bed and arrested by the Ihat team and has now been paid compensation for wrongful detention. Three servicemen face prosecution for manslaughter despite being cleared a decade ago by a military inquiry.
This investigation, set up in 2010 to last two years, will not now be completed until 2019 at the earliest – some 16 years after the action in Iraq took place. The principle that justice delayed is justice denied applies as much to the alleged perpetrator as to the victims. If the Government cannot shut down Ihat then some mitigation is needed. At the very least, dawn arrests of those under investigation as though they are common criminals must stop. The Government should also announce that the UK will derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of future overseas armed conflicts and revive Armed Forces’ Crown immunity for foreign combat missions.
