What does Brexit mean for the NHS? One risk, highlighted by a leading thinktank on Thursday, is the loss of 57,000 European workers. The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggest in a report that British citizenship should be offered to EU nationals to avoid a collapse in the service.
Chris Murray, who compiled the report, said: “It is critical to public health that these workers do not seek jobs elsewhere. All EU nationals who work for the NHS, or as locums in the NHS system, should be eligible to apply for British citizenship. This offer should be organised by the regional NHS and mental health trusts, who would be responsible for writing to all NHS staff who are EU nationals to inform them of their eligibility.”
