It appears that what the foreign ministers agree is not necessarily the view shared by the American and Russian defence establishments. A view is gaining ground that the two countries are using Syria as a proxy for a bigger power game while the people of this benighted land remain stuck in the middle. One way to show that this is not the case would be for Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, although he is not in New York, to put the agreement back together, if only to allow the relief operation to restart. The countries have a shared enemy in the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which needs to be dealt with even if they disagree over President Assadâ€™s future role in Syria.
In his final speech to the UN General Assembly, President Obama said it was important to pursue a diplomatic settlement in Syria and to ensure the delivery of aid as a matter of urgency. But it is in his hands and those of President Putin to bring this about; and if the UN is to mean anything at all then this gathering should afford the opportunity to keep diplomacy on track and put mutual suspicions aside.
Only with a ceasefire will it be possible to restart a political process, which will take place under UN auspices. It is the essential first component of a negotiated settlement, without which the misery of the Syrian people still left in the country will continue for years to come.
