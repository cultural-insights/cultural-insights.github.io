The most unfortunate illness of Mr Bevin has thrown yet further burdens on Mr Attlee, who has had to add Paris to Palestine among his major toils. He is carrying, indeed, a peak-load of problems. For a tenant of 10 Downing Street in these days there is required not only the prudence of Ulysses but the labouring capacity of Hercules. Mr Attlee had intended a trip to Australia but it now seems that he will be lucky to get as far as Chequers.
May his health remain unimpaired. The nation’s sympathy and good wishes are certainly his. He has served the country throughout his last year of premiership and continuous “headaches” with coolness and firmness and he has led his party with a good footing and good taste sadly absent from some of his colleagues’ performances.
He has never in his speeches struck the presumptuous or the blustering, bullying, braggadocio note so dear to certain of the ministers who have much to learn from their chief in manners and judgment.

The remarkable thing about Southend is that it hasn’t changed. It is about the only place in England which is the same. There are no inhibitions, no doubts; enjoyment does not end in a hangover of shame. “The last thing the missus says to me this morning was, ‘Look after yourself, and don’t spend too much.’ But she don’t understand. I like to spend a lot, corse anyway after the holidays the money’s goin’ to roll in.” They are all like him. Never has there been so much money about, never have these workers spent with quite the same feeling that money would “roll in” afterwards. It is as if everybody’s rich aunt had died overnight.
