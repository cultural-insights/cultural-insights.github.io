If you’re planning on staying in the UK this bank holiday, then you’re far from alone. Holidaying at home is becoming increasingly popular – with figures showing a 6% rise this year in the number of Brits choosing to stay local.
This rise was recorded by Visit England, who noted that just over 5 million Britons are planning to stay in the UK over the bank holiday weekend. The government now plans to launch a tourism action plan (including cutting red tape for B&Bs) to make accommodate growing interest in the “staycation”, which is possibly a result of exchange rates weakening post-Brexit and concerns about security overseas.
