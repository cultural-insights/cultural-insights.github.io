Every Friday from 12pm to 4.30pm we run Guardian Social, an online space for readers to discuss the week’s news and comment, with views from inside and outside the building. You can see previous ones here. 
We’d like you to decide what we talk about each week. Maybe there is a Guardian article you particularly enjoyed, and you’d like to hear more about it from the author? Or a review you disagreed with, and you’d like to discuss the book, film, album or TV show in question with other Guardian readers? 
Perhaps there’s a viral video from the past week that you want us to share and discuss, or a personal project you’ve embarked on – running, baking, swimming – and you’d like tips and advice from other readers. Do you have a question to pose to one of our journalists specifically? Let us know. Last week we debated everything from the film Suicide Squad to the week in science.
You can tell us what you’d like to discuss this week, and pose a question for our journalists via the form below. Look forward to seeing you on Friday!
