It has been demonstrated repeatedly in recent years that the ECHR – and the manner in which the Human Rights Act obliges British authorities to observe it – can create cases that offend against natural justice, common sense and the idea of self-government. It is surely right that British people, military and civilian alike, should only be tried under laws made by politicians they can vote for, and sack. Yet the ECHR, its judges and authors are beyond the scope or scrutiny of any voter; we must simply accept the consequences of the convention, no matter how offensive, and without redress. 
Theresa May once suggested withdrawing from the ECHR, though she appears to have abandoned that plan in preference for a new Bill of Rights that enacts the convention’s principles more intelligently. This Bill is badly overdue; Liz Truss, the Justice Secretary, should make it her top priority to produce the legislation – including provisions that give ministers much greater discretion over historic cases of military justice.
