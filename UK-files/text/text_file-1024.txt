This week, host Jessica Valenti asks: do you call yourself a feminist? Whether you do or don’t, the word evokes thoughts or feelings based on preconceived notions of what feminism means.

Valenti is joined by guests Julia Serano, activist and author of Excluded: Making Feminist and Queer Movements More Inclusive and Dr Brittney Cooper, assistant professor of women’s and gender studies at Rutgers University and co-founder of Crunk Feminist Collective to talk about the word “feminism” and some of the complications around it.

Why do some people who have feminist beliefs choose not to use the word? Is it important to call yourself a feminist? Why are we so concerned with who is “allowed” to use the term and who isn’t?

As always, we hope you’ll join the conversation in the comments below.
