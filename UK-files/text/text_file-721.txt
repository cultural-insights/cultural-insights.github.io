While women have been gaining rights in the past decades, workplace sexism still exists in many insidious forms. Sexism in the workplace is arguably even more difficult to navigate today because it is often subtle and difficult to pinpoint.

This week, host Jessica Valenti is joined by Jessica Bennett, feature writer and columnist at the New York Times and author of Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace.

Valenti and Bennett discuss the ways in which workplace policies still don’t protect women from “hoverers” and “man-terruptors”. They also touch on the persistent problems of “bropropriators”, “lactahaters” and offer real life hacks to handle these types of coworkers.

Have you tried an old fashioned “thank and yank”? Or have you found the right “wom-interruptor” to keep by your side? Join the discussion in the comments below.
