Cancer is no longer the death sentence it once was – people are now twice as likely to live at least 10 years after being diagnosed than they were 35 years ago.




Thousands of cancer sufferers surviving decades after diagnosis




That is according to new research by Macmillan Cancer Support, which found more than 170,000 people in the UK who were diagnosed in the 1970s and 1980s are still alive – something the charity described as an “extraordinary” number.
More people now survive because of better treatment, the charity said, although it acknowledged that there was still a huge variation in survival rates according to cancer type.
