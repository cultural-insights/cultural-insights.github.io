Nowhere is this more true than the European Union, where philosophy and policy are largely at odds with the three common-sense principles.
EU members are obliged to abandon internal border controls, and the EU fails woefully to distinguish between economic migrants and refugees, effectively allowing both to use and abuse its right to free movement.
EU rules obliging countries to process apparent refugees on arrival and not let them travel on to other states are widely ignored.
The resulting mess was a significant reason for Britain voting to leave and once we are outside the EU, we will be able at last to act on Mrs May’s sensible propositions. 
We have written here before that Brexit offers scope for fresh action and thinking. Mrs May is showing she is capable of rising to the challenge on migration. We hope other world leaders are too.
