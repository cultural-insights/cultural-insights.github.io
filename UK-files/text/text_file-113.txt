I think it’s great that you talk about the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, but, as someone who campaigns for the restoration of wildlife, presumably on the basis of being a lover of animals - I’d like to know what you think to the ethical questions about eating meat, dairy and eggs?

Many people argue that if we don’t need to eat these things, then if we are serious about animal welfare, then on the basis that we do not need to eat them in order to live an optimally healthy life, then we should eliminate them altogether on those grounds alone.

I feel that this is the cognitive shift that we need in order to move to plant based diets, as the reductionism that will result from the environmental argument is not enough to offer a real shift. What are your thoughts on this?
