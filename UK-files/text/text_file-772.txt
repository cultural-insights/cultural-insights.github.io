We got in an interesting comment via our form from a 32-year-old parent of two children, based in Scotland. They offer a hopeful picture of how to engage kids in healthy eating:

All our main meals are cooked with fresh ingredients so we know what’s going in. Kids are involved in the cooking (and growing food) so they learn to enjoy food. Sweet/sugary treats are not forbidden but are limited, usually as a treat with lunch or after school on a Friday. My kids are young enough that I don’t have to worry about them eating junk food unless we give them it, they don’t get fizzy juice and the diluting juice they do get is sugar free. We don’t eat takeaways or prepacked food. Biggest issue is breakfast cereals, even Wheetabix has added sugar these days!



They also talked about a great initiative their school is involved in:

Our school does a Wednesday wander where all the kids (preschool to p7) all walk, run, skip etc a mile every Wednesday. The kids love it!

All the schools in the local area grow their own fruit and veg and do basic cooking with the ingredients they’ve grown. We also have a new community growing area that’s trying to get families out growing and cooking their own food.



That’s something to be hopeful for and a nice note to end on.
