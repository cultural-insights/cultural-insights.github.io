In March, after the Brussels airport and train attacks, security was stepped up in New York: Bill De Blasio, mayor of New York, said there have been 20 terror plots directed at the city since September 11.
"Each one was thwarted because [the NYPD] has such an extraordinary capacity," he said.
"We have a much stronger partnership with the FBI and Homeland Security and the other partners, both federal and state, than we ever had before," he said. "That's the first thing every New Yorker should think about - for 15 years the NYPD has prevented something like this from happening.
"We cannot let the terrorists change who we are."
