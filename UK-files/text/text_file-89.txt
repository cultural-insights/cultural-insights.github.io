Walking down an aisle in any toy store, it would seem that the way children play should be broken down by gender: pink and glitter for girls, blue and superheroes for boys. But has it always been this way?

This week, host Jessica Valenti is joined by Peggy Orenstein, author of many books including Cinderella Ate My Daughter and most recently, Girls and Sex, to tackle the question: how can we break our girls from toys that promote domesticity and hyper-feminization without teaching them that princesses and pink are bad?

Valenti and Orenstein also talk about the history of pink v blue, gender neutral toys and the origin of this divide. Orenstein also offers advice to parents.

“There’s so many ways that you can find that scratch that itch of wanting to feel pride and joy and fun in being a girl,” says Orenstein. “And I would say the same thing for parents of boys: not only having those same things for boys, but making sure that your son also has lots of things that reinforce that girls are people too who do the same things that boys do.”
