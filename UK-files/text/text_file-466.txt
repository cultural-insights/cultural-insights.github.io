The latest plan of action for junior doctors in England, who are locked in a longstanding dispute with the government over new contracts, is an unprecedented five-day strike this month.
The British Medical Association (BMA) agreed on a walk-out on Wednesday, the first since its members rejected the government’s final offer on the contract. 




NHS junior doctors to stage five consecutive days of strikes in September




It comes amid a year of strikes (the longest lasting for two consecutive days) and meetings, with more than 100,000 operations and outpatient appointments cancelled so far as a result of industrial action.
Junior doctors seemed close to reaching an agreement with the government in May, when a compromise deal was agreed between the BMA and health secretary Jeremy Hunt. However, there was a split among members when it came to accepting it: 58% against, and 42% in favour.
So what is the feeling among junior doctors now? Are you pro a five-day walk-out or did you vote to accept the deal in May? Are you worried about the impact of being off for five days?
We also want to hear from other people working in the NHS about whether they support this action or not. Are you worried it’s a step too far or do you think this action is absolutely necessary?
