Two years ago today the people of Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. David Cameron, the then prime minister, breathed a huge sigh of relief. But fast forward to 23 June, the day of the European Union referendum, and his luck finally ran out.
Never in our peacetime history have so many dials required resetting as a consequence of a single day’s events. Cameron has gone and so that task falls to Theresa May. The shift in the UK’s place in the world is comparable only to the disposal of the British Empire – which took place over many years and to a timetable largely under the control of British ministers. It left remarkably few psychological scars. By comparison, 23 June was guillotine day.
The referendum was a shock to the political system and our constitutional framework. But that framework was already shifting. Since May 2010 we have had two UK-wide referendums – on the voting system and on EU membership – and a third where, although the question was limited to the voters of Scotland, the potential impact on the whole of the UK was considerable.
We have seen the introduction of fixed-term parliaments and of police and crime commissioners. Local authorities have seen their role in education, housing and social care eroded. A national infrastructure commission has been established to speed up major projects in transport and other areas. The fabric of local accountability and control is shifting. There is talk of devolving power away from Whitehall and Westminster to local level, including further directly elected mayors.
A lot of change and more to come, but these issues have not been shaped by any constitutional master plan. Under Cameron, they seemed to be a reactive, piecemeal process, in response to short-term political pressures.
And what about the issues that have not been raised? The government’s devolution concessions in Scotland have inevitably led to questions from Wales and the regions of England. While the Blair government showed its reforming credentials in devolution, limited reforms to the Lords and the introduction of a London mayor, most of England was unaffected.
And while turnout in the EU referendum was high, turnout in elections – even general elections – is far lower than 30 years ago. When the voters do bother to vote, they are increasingly less inclined to support the two big brands at Westminster. The minor parties – the Greens, Ukip and the nationalists – are now in the ascendancy.
Our democratic process – indeed, our democracy – is drifting. It is time to have a broader look at how we conduct the business of democratic representative government. We need to shape a system that is better understood and which commands the electorate’s confidence.
If we had been writing this article in an earlier age, the words royal commission would have appeared long before now. Forty years ago, a royal commission was the response of choice to a wide range of issues: anything from trade unions to medical education to gambling.
But the fact that past commissions achieved less than expected does not mean we should automatically reject the idea. Indeed, they could be just the type of life raft that the new prime minister needs. We believe there is now a case for a royal commission to consider the design and operation of our democratic processes, as well as the internal relationships between the nations and regions of the UK.
There are 10 big issues:
• What can be done to improve the effectiveness of legislators in the House of Commons and their response to the concerns of voters?
• What should be the future relationships between the two Houses of Parliament?
• Is devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland working as well as it could, and how should we respond to proposals for a second Scottish referendum on independence?
• Is there now a case for devolution to England, either to the country as a whole or to the regions? If so, in what form?
• What changes are needed in local government? What should its role be in education, housing, transport and health (including a possible combined health and social care system)?
• How could the structure of central government (the “machinery of government”) be reshaped to make it more responsive to the needs of the population?
• Is there a case for new arrangements to improve democratic accountability of the public bodies overseeing important local services such as NHS trusts or non-departmental public bodies – or even more direct scrutiny by parliament and its select committees?
• Should major constitutional decisions, such as calling referendums, be removed from the pressing concerns of politicians and vested in a new independent constitutional review body, or perhaps subjected to a “super majority” in parliament?
• What could be done to increase participation in the democratic process (such as voting at the age of 16, electronic voting, elections on Sundays, polling stations at supermarkets and so on)?
• How can we address the legitimate concerns about tax avoidance and tax havens under the British crown?
Some of these areas have been looked at before but usually only in isolation. Few of the proposals which have emerged have made much headway. In the uncertain future we now face, it is time to look at them in the round. We need to make our systems fit and proper for the 21st century.
The UK has long prided itself on punching above its weight in the world. The Brexit decision requires us to reconsider our position in the new global order. But first we need to look with urgency at how the mechanisms in our system work together. This requires us to focus with intensity and urgency on how we want our democratic processes to work. We are confident that the UK has the resources and the energy to do that, and that the establishment of a royal commission on the constitution would assist that process. We hope the new prime minister agrees.
